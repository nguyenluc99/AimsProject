himself

there

are

lighter

This

is  
x

x
a  
x

x
story

x
of  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
languages  
x

x
and  
x

x
letters  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
different  
x

x
from  
x

x
ours  
x

x
of  
x

x
today. 
x

x
English  
x

x
is  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
represent  
x

x
the

languages. 
x

x
But  
x

x
two  
x

x
points  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
noted. 
x

x
(1)  
x

x
In

x
dwarf

is  
x

x
dwarfs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
adjective  
x

x
is  
x

x
dwarfish. 
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
story  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
dvarvish  
x

x
are  
x

x
used-,  
x

x
but  
x

x
only  
x

x
when  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
people  
x

x
to  
x

x
whom  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield

x

x
or  
x

x
two

x
places

x
but  
x

x
is  
x

x
usually  
x

x
translated  
x

x
goblin

x
(or

hobgoblin

for

the

the

hobbits’

form  
x

x
of

x
the

x
name  
x

x
given  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
these  
x

x
creatures,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
not

x
connected  
x

x
at  
x

x
all

ork,

x
to

of

Runes  
x

x
were  
x

old

originally

the

the

a

hobbit.

Not

a

nasty,

dirty,

of

worms

an

a

dry,

to

down

on

or  
x

to

eat:  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit-hole,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that

means  
x

x
  
x

x
comfort. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
perfectly  
x

x
round  
x

x
door  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
porthole,  
x

x
  
x

x
painted  
x

x
green,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
shiny  
x

yellow

brass  
x

x
knob  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
exact  
x

x
middle. 
x

x
The  
x

x
door  
x

x
opened  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tube-shaped  
x

x
hall  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
tunnel:  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
without  
x

x
smoke,  
x

x
with  
x

x
panelled  
x

x
  
x

x
walls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
floors  
x

x
tiled

carpeted,

x

x
with

polished

chairs,

lots

and

lots

of

pegs

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
hats  
x

x
and

x
coats  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
fond  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
visitors. 
x

x
The  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
wound  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on,  
x

x
going  
x

x
  
x

x
fairly  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
straight  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill,  
x

x
as  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
miles  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
called  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
little  
x

x
round  
x

x
doors  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
first  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
side  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
another. 
x

x
No  
x

x
going  
x

x
upstairs  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit:  
x

x
  
x

x
bedrooms,  
x

x
bathrooms,  
x

x
cellars,  
x

x
pantries  
x

x
(lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
these),  
x

x
wardrobes  
x

x
(he  
x

x
had  
x

x
whole  
x

x
rooms  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
devoted  
x

x
to  
x

x
clothes),  
x

x
kitchens,  
x

x
dining-rooms,  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
passage. 
x

x
The  
x

x
best  
x

x
rooms  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
left-hand  
x

x
side  
x

x
(going  
x

x
in),  
x

x
for  
x

x
these  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
ones  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
windows,  
x

x
deep-set  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
windows  
x

x
looking  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
garden,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
meadows  
x

x
beyond,  
x

x
sloping  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
river. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
well-to-do  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
name  
x

x
was  
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Bagginses  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
lived  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
neighbourhood  
x

x
of  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
people  
x

x
considered  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
respectable,  
x

x
not  
x

x
only  
x

x
because  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
rich,  
x

x
but  
x

x
also  
x

x
because  
x

x
they  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
any  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
or  
x

x
did  
x

x
anything  
x

x
unexpected:  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
tell  
x

x
what  
x

x
a  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
would  
x

x
say  
x

x
on  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
question  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
bother  
x

x
of  
x

x
asking  
x

x
him. 
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
story  
x

x
of  
x

x
how  
x

x
a  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
had  
x

x
an  
x

x
adventure,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
doing  
x

x
and  
x

x
saying  
x

x
things  
x

x
  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
unexpected. 
x

x
He  
x

x
may  
x

x
have  
x

x
lost  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
neighbours’  
x

x
respect,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
gained  
x

x
—  
x

x
well,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
see  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
gained  
x

x
anything  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
mother  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
particular  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
—  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit?  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
need  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
description  
x

x
nowadays,  
x

x
since  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
become  
x

x
  
x

x
rare  
x

x
and  
x

x
shy  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Big  
x

x
People,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
call  
x

x
us. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
are  
x

x
(or  
x

x
were)  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
people,  
x

x
about  
x

x
half  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
height,  
x

x
and  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
bearded  
x

x
Dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
Hobbits  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
beards. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
little  
x

x
or  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
about  
x

x
them,  
x

x
except  
x

x
the  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
everyday  
x

x
sort  
x

x
which  
x

x
helps  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
disappear  
x

x
  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
and  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
when  
x

x
large  
x

x
stupid  
x

x
folk  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
me  
x

x
come  
x

x
blundering  
x

x
along,  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
like  
x

x
elephants  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
hear  
x

x
a  
x

x
mile  
x

x
  
x

x
off. 
x

x
They  
x

x
are  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
fat  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
stomach;  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
dress  
x

x
in  
x

x
bright  
x

x
colours  
x

x
(chiefly  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
yellow);  
x

x
wear  
x

x
no  
x

x
shoes,  
x

x
because  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
grow  
x

x
  
x

x
natural  
x

x
leathery  
x

x
soles  
x

x
and  
x

x
thick  
x

x
warm  
x

x
brown  
x

x
  
x

x
hair  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
stuff  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
(which  
x

x
is  
x

x
curly);  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
long  
x

x
clever  
x

x
brown  
x

x
fingers,  
x

x
good-natured  
x

x
  
x

x
faces,  
x

x
and  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
deep  
x

x
fruity  
x

x
laughs  
x

x
(especially  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
dinner,  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
twice  
x

x
a  
x

x
day  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
get  
x

x
it). 
x

x
Now  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
with.

As

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
saying,  
x

x
the  
x

x
mother  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
—  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
famous  
x

x
  
x

x
Belladonna  
x

x
Took,  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
three  
x

x
remarkable  
x

x
  
x

x
daughters  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Old  
x

x
Took,  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
lived  
x

x
across  
x

x
The  
x

x
Water,  
x

x
the  
x

x
small  
x

x
river  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
ran  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
foot  
x

x
of  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
often  
x

x
said  
x

x
(in  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
families)  
x

x
that  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Took  
x

x
  
x

x
ancestors  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
taken  
x

x
a  
x

x
fairy  
x

x
wife. 
x

x
That  
x

x
  
x

x
was,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
absurd,  
x

x
but  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
still  
x

x
something  
x

x
not  
x

x
entirely  
x

x
hobbitlike  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
once  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
members  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Took-clan  
x

x
would  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
adventures. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
discreetly  
x

x
disappeared,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
family  
x

x
hushed  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
up;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
fact  
x

x
remained  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
Tooks  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
respectable  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
Bagginses,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
undoubtedly  
x

x
richer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
that  
x

x
Belladonna  
x

x
Took  
x

x
ever  
x

x
had  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
after  
x

x
she  
x

x
became  
x

x
Mrs. 
x

x
Bungo  
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
Bungo,  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
father,  
x

x
built  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
luxurious  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
for  
x

x
her  
x

x
(and  
x

x
partly  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
her  
x

x
money)  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
found  
x

x
either  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
or  
x

x
over  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
or  
x

x
across  
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
Water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
remained  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
days. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
probable  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
her  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
son,  
x

x
although  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
and  
x

x
behaved  
x

x
exactly  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
second  
x

x
edition  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
solid  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
father,  
x

x
got  
x

x
something  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
queer  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
make-up  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Took  
x

x
side,  
x

x
something  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
waited  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
out. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
chance  
x

x
never  
x

x
arrived,  
x

x
until  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
grown  
x

x
up,  
x

x
being  
x

x
about  
x

x
fifty  
x

x
years  
x

x
old  
x

x
or  
x

x
so,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
living  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
built  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
father,  
x

x
which  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
just  
x

x
described  
x

x
for  
x

x
you,  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
apparently  
x

x
settled  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
immovably. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
By  
x

x
some  
x

x
curious  
x

x
chance  
x

x
one  
x

x
morning  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
ago  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
world,  
x

x
when  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
less  
x

x
noise  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
green,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
numerous  
x

x
and  
x

x
prosperous,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
standing  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
door  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
smoking  
x

x
an  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
long  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
  
x

x
pipe  
x

x
that  
x

x
reached  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
woolly  
x

x
toes  
x

x
  
x

x
(neatly  
x

x
brushed)  
x

x
—  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
came  
x

x
by. 
x

x
Gandalf!  
x

x
If  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
quarter  
x

x
of  
x

x
what  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
about  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
only  
x

x
heard  
x

x
very  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear,  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
prepared  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
remarkable  
x

x
tale. 
x

x
Tales  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
sprouted  
x

x
up  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
he  
x

x
went,  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
extraordinary  
x

x
  
x

x
fashion. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
down  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
for  
x

x
ages  
x

x
and  
x

x
ages,  
x

x
not  
x

x
since  
x

x
his  
x

x
friend  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Old  
x

x
Took  
x

x
died,  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
almost  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
away  
x

x
over  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
and  
x

x
across  
x

x
The  
x

x
Water  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
businesses  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
since  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
small  
x

x
hobbit-boys  
x

x
and  
x

x
hobbit-girls. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
unsuspecting  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
man  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
staff. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tall  
x

x
pointed  
x

x
blue  
x

x
hat,  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
grey  
x

x
cloak,  
x

x
a  
x

x
silver  
x

x
  
x

x
scarf  
x

x
over  
x

x
which  
x

x
his  
x

x
long  
x

x
white  
x

x
beard  
x

x
hung  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
below  
x

x
his  
x

x
waist,  
x

x
and  
x

x
immense  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
boots. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
Morning!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
meant  
x

x
  
x

x
it. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
was  
x

x
shining,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
green. 
x

x
But  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
bushy  
x

x
eyebrows  
x

x
that  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
out  
x

x
further  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
brim  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
shady  
x

x
hat. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
mean?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Do  
x

x
you  
x

x
wish  
x

x
  
x

x
me  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
morning,  
x

x
or  
x

x
mean  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
whether  
x

x
I  
x

x
want  
x

x
it  
x

x
or  
x

x
not;  
x

x
or  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
feel  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
this  
x

x
morning;  
x

x
or  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
morning  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
on?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“All  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
fine  
x

x
morning  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
pipe  
x

x
of  
x

x
tobacco  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
doors,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
bargain. 
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
pipe  
x

x
about  
x

x
you,  
x

x
  
x

x
sit  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
fill  
x

x
of  
x

x
mine!  
x

x
There’s  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
hurry,  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
day  
x

x
before  
x

x
us!”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
seat  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
door,  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
blew  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
grey  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
that  
x

x
sailed  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
without  
x

x
  
x

x
breaking  
x

x
and  
x

The

x
  
x

x
“Very

pretty!”

said

Gandalf.

“But

I

have

no

time

to

blow

smoke-rings  
x

x
this

morning. 
x

x
I

am

looking

for

someone

to

in

an

that

I

am

x
arranging,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
very  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
anyone.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

x
should  
x

x
think  
x

x
so  
x

x
—  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
parts!  
x

x
We  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
plain  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
folk  
x

x
and  
x

x
have

no  
x

x
use  
x

x
for  
x

x
adventures. 
x

x
  
x

x
Nasty  
x

x
disturbing  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
things!  
x

x
Make  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
late  
x

x
for  
x

x
dinner!  
x

x
I

can’t

x

what  
x

x
anybody  
x

x
  
x

x
sees  
x

x
in

them,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
our  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
thumb  
x

x
behind  
x

x
his  
x

x
braces,  
x

x
and  
x

x
blew  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
even  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
smoke-ring. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
morning  
x

x
letters,  
x

x
and  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
read,  
x

x
  
x

x
pretending  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
notice  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
man. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
decided  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
sort,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
away. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
man  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
move. 
x

x
He  
x

x
stood  
x

x
leaning  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
stick  
x

x
and  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
without  
x

x
saying  
x

x
  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
till  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
got  
x

x
quite  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
cross. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
morning!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
at  
x

x
last. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
want  
x

x
any

x
adventures  
x

x
here,

you!

x
You

The

Hill

across  
x

The

Water.”  
x

x
By  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
meant  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
conversation  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
an

x
end.

x

Gandalf.

“Now

x

x
any  
x

x
time  
x

x
you  
x

x
like!  
x

x
Why  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
tomorrow?  
x

x
Come  
x

x
tomorrow!  
x

x
Good  
x

x
bye!”  
x

x
With  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
scuttled  
x

x
inside  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
green  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
shut  
x

x
it  
x

x
as  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
dared,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
seem  
x

x
rude. 
x

x
Wizards  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
wizards. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
did  
x

x
I  
x

x
ask  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
tea  
x

x
for!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
pantry. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
had  
x

x
breakfast,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
a  
x

x
cake  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink  
x

x
of  
x

x
something  
x

x
would  
x

x
do  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
after  
x

x
his  
x

x
fright. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
meantime  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
standing  
x

x
  
x

x
outside  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
long  
x

x
but  
x

x
quietly. 
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
spike  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
staff  
x

x
scratched  
x

x
a  
x

x
queer  
x

x
sign  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
green  
x

x
front-door. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
strode  
x

x
away,  
x

x
just  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
finishing  
x

x
his  
x

x
second  
x

x
cake  
x

x
and  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
very  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
day  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
almost  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
remember  
x

x
things  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,  
x

x
  
x

x
unless  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
them  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
Engagement  
x

x
  
x

x
Tablet:  
x

x
like  
x

x
this:  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
Tea  
x

x
Wednesday. 
x

x
  
x

x
Yesterday  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
too  
x

x
flustered  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
  
x

x
anything  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kind. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
before  
x

x
tea-time  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
ring  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
front-door  
x

x
bell,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
remembered!  
x

x
He  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
kettle,  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
out  
x

x
another  
x

x
cup  
x

x
and  
x

x
saucer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
extra  
x

x
cake  
x

x
or  
x

x
two,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
so  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
you  
x

x
waiting!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
blue  
x

x
beard  
x

x
  
x

x
tucked  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
golden  
x

x
belt,  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
bright  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
his  
x

x
dark-green  
x

x
hood. 
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door  
x

x
was  
x

x
opened,  
x

x
he  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
expected. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
hung  
x

x
his  
x

x
hooded  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
  
x

x
peg,  
x

x
and  
x

x
“Dwalin  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
low  
x

x
bow. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
at  
x

x
yours!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
too  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
any  
x

x
questions  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
moment. 
x

x
When  
x

x
the  
x

x
silence  
x

x
that  
x

x
followed  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
become  
x

x
uncomfortable,  
x

x
he  
x

x
added:  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
tea;  
x

x
pray  
x

x
come  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
A  
x

x
little  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
perhaps,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
meant  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
kindly. 
x

x
And  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
you  
x

x
do,  
x

x
if  
x

x
an  
x

x
uninvited  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
came  
x

x
and  
x

x
hung  
x

x
his  
x

x
things  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
word  
x

x
of  
x

x
explanation?  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
at  
x

x
table  
x

x
long,  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
third  
x

x
cake,  
x

x
when  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
another  
x

x
even  
x

x
louder  
x

x
ring  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bell. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Excuse  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
and  
x

x
off  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“So  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
here  
x

x
at  
x

x
last!”  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
this  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
Instead  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
old-looking  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
step  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
white  
x

x
beard  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
scarlet  
x

x
hood;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
too  
x

x
hopped  
x

x
inside  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
was  
x

x
open,  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
invited. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
see  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
arrive  
x

x
already,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
caught  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dwalin’s  
x

x
green  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
up. 
x

x
He  
x

x
hung  
x

x
his  
x

x
red  
x

x
one  
x

x
next  
x

x
to  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
“Balin  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hand  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
breast. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thank  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
gasp. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
correct  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
arrive  
x

x
had  
x

x
flustered  
x

x
him  
x

x
badly. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
liked  
x

x
visitors,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
them  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
arrived,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
preferred  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
thought  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cakes  
x

x
might  
x

x
run  
x

x
short,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
—  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
host:  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
his  
x

x
duty  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
to  
x

x
it  
x

x
however  
x

x
  
x

x
painful  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
without. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
along  
x

x
in,  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
some  
x

x
tea!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
after  
x

x
taking  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
breath. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
little  
x

x
beer  
x

x
would  
x

x
suit  
x

x
me  
x

x
better,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
to  
x

x
you,  
x

x
my  
x

x
good  
x

x
sir,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
white  
x

x
beard. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
mind  
x

x
some  
x

x
cake  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
seed-cake,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
any.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Lots!”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
answering,  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
surprise;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
scuttling  
x

x
off,  
x

x
  
x

x
too,  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellar  
x

x
to  
x

x
fill  
x

x
a  
x

x
pint  
x

x
beer-mug,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
pantry  
x

x
to  
x

x
fetch  
x

x
two  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
round  
x

x
seed-  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
cakes  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
baked  
x

x
that  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
after-supper  
x

x
morsel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
back  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
talking  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
table  
x

x
like  
x

x
old  
x

x
friends  
x

x
(as  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
brothers). 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
plumped  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
beer  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
cake  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
loud  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bell  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Gandalf  
x

x
for  
x

x
certain  
x

x
this  
x

x
time,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
puffed  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage. 
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
two  
x

x
more  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
both  
x

x
with  
x

x
blue  
x

x
hoods,  
x

x
  
x

x
silver  
x

x
belts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
beards;  
x

x
and  
x

x
each  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
carried  
x

x
a  
x

x
bag  
x

x
of  
x

x
tools  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
spade. 
x

x
In  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
hopped,  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
open  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
can  
x

x
I  
x

x
do  
x

x
for  
x

x
you,  
x

x
my  
x

x
dwarves?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Kili  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
one. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili!”  
x

x
added  
x

x
the  
x

x
other;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
both  
x

x
swept  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
blue  
x

x
hoods  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“At  
x

x
yours  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
family’s!”  
x

x
replied  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
  
x

x
remembering  
x

x
his  
x

x
manners  
x

x
this  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dwalin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
here  
x

x
already,  
x

x
I  
x

x
see,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Kili. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
join  
x

x
the  
x

x
throng!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Throng!”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
that. 
x

x
I  
x

x
really  
x

x
must  
x

x
sit  
x

x
down  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
minute  
x

x
and  
x

x
collect  
x

x
my  
x

x
wits,  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink.”  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
sip  
x

x
—  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
corner,  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
four  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
sat  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
table,  
x

x
and  
x

x
talked  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
mines  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
troubles  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
depredations  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragons,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
other  
x

x
things  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
understand,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
want  
x

x
to,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
much  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
adventurous  
x

x
—  
x

x
when,  
x

x
ding-dong-a-ling-dang,  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
bell  
x

x
rang  
x

x
again,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
some  
x

x
naughty  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit-boy  
x

x
was  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
pull  
x

x
the  
x

x
handle  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Someone  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
door!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
blinking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Some  
x

x
four,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
say  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili. 
x

x
“Besides,  
x

x
we  
x

x
saw  
x

x
them  
x

x
coming  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
us  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
happen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
all  
x

x
stay  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
supper. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
bell  
x

x
rang  
x

x
again  
x

x
louder  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
run  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
four  
x

x
after  
x

x
all,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
five. 
x

x
Another  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
along  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
turned  
x

x
the  
x

x
knob,  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
bowing  
x

x
and  
x

x
saying  
x

x
“at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service”  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
after  
x

x
another. 
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
Ori,  
x

x
Oin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
their  
x

x
names;  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
two  
x

x
purple  
x

x
  
x

x
hoods,  
x

x
a  
x

x
grey  
x

x
hood,  
x

x
a  
x

x
brown  
x

x
hood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
white  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
were  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
pegs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
off  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
marched  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
broad  
x

x
hands  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver  
x

x
belts  
x

x
to  
x

x
join  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
almost  
x

x
become  
x

x
a  
x

x
throng. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
called  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
ale,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
for  
x

x
porter,  
x

x
and  
x

x
one  
x

x
for  
x

x
coffee,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
for  
x

x
cakes;  
x

x
so  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
very  
x

x
busy  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
big  
x

x
jug  
x

x
of  
x

x
coffee  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
been  
x

x
set  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hearth,  
x

x
the  
x

x
seed-cakes  
x

x
were  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
starting  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
round  
x

x
of  
x

x
buttered  
x

x
  
x

x
scones,  
x

x
when  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
knock. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
hard  
x

x
rat-tat  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
  
x

x
green  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Somebody  
x

x
was  
x

x
banging  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stick!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage,  
x

x
very  
x

x
angry,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
bewildered  
x

x
and  
x

x
bewuthered  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
awkward  
x

x
Wednesday  
x

x
he  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
remembered. 
x

x
He  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
open  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
jerk,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
fell  
x

x
in,  
x

x
one  
x

x
on  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
other. 
x

x
  
x

x
More  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
four  
x

x
more!  
x

x
And  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
leaning  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
staff  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
laughing. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
made  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
dent  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
door;  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
also,  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
way,  
x

x
  
x

x
knocked  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
mark  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning  
x

x
before. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Carefully!  
x

x
Carefully!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
you,  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
friends  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
mat,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
open  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
pop-gun!  
x

x
Let  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
introduce  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
especially  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“At  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
standing  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
row. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
hung  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
hoods  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
pale  
x

x
green  
x

x
one;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
a  
x

x
sky-blue  
x

x
one  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
silver  
x

x
tassel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
last  
x

x
belonged  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
an  
x

x
enormously  
x

x
  
x

x
important  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
no  
x

x
other  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
at  
x

x
falling  
x

x
flat  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
mat  
x

x
with  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
on  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
For  
x

x
one  
x

x
thing  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
was  
x

x
immensely  
x

x
fat  
x

x
and  
x

x
heavy. 
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
haughty,  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
service',  
x

x
but  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
said  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
so  
x

x
many  
x

x
times,  
x

x
that  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
grunted  
x

x
  
x

x
“pray  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
mention  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
and  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
frowning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
all  
x

x
here!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
looking  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
row  
x

x
of  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
hoods  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
  
x

x
detachable  
x

x
party  
x

x
hoods  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
hat  
x

x
  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
pegs. 
x

x
“Quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
gathering!  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
hope  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
something  
x

x
left  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
late-comers  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
and  
x

x
drink!  
x

x
What’s  
x

x
that?  
x

x
Tea!  
x

x
No  
x

x
thank  
x

x
  
x

x
you!  
x

x
A  
x

x
little  
x

x
red  
x

x
wine,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
for  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
for  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
raspberry  
x

x
jam  
x

x
and  
x

x
apple-tart,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bifur. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
mince-pies  
x

x
and  
x

x
cheese,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bofur. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
pork-pie  
x

x
and  
x

x
salad,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bombur. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
more  
x

x
cakes

—

and

ale

and

coffee,  
x

if

you

don’t

x

x
called  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the

door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Put

on

a

few

eggs,

there’s

a

good  
x

fellow!”  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
called  
x

x
after  
x

x
him,  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
stumped  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
pantries. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
just  
x

x
bring  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold

chicken

pickles!”  
x

x

“Seems

to

know

much

about

of

my

larders

as

I

do

myself!”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
positively  
x

x
flummoxed,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
whether  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
right  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
house. 
x

x
By  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottles  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
dishes  
x

x
and  
x

x
knives  
x

x
and  
x

x
forks  
x

x
and  
x

x
glasses  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
plates  
x

x
and  
x

x
spoons  
x

x
and  
x

x
things  
x

x
piled  
x

x
up  
x

x
on  
x

x
big  
x

x
  
x

x
trays,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
very  
x

x
hot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
red  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
face,  
x

x
and  
x

x
annoyed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Confusticate  
x

x
and  
x

x
bebother  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
they  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
lend  
x

x
a  
x

x
hand?”  
x

x
Lo  
x

x
and  
x

x
behold!  
x

x
there  
x

x
stood  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

kitchen,  
x

and  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
say  
x

x
knife  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
whisked  
x

x
the  
x

x
trays  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
couple  
x

x
of  
x

x
small  
x

x
tables  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
parlour  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
everything  
x

x
afresh. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
sat  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
party  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
all  
x

x
round:  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stool  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
fireside,  
x

x
nibbling  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
biscuit  
x

x
(his  
x

x
  
x

x
appetite  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
taken  
x

x
away),  
x

x
and  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
look  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
perfectly  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
least  
x

x
an  
x

x
adventure. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
ate  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
ate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
talked  
x

x
and  
x

x
talked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
time  
x

x
got  
x

x
on. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
their  
x

x
chairs  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
move  
x

x
to  
x

x
collect  
x

x
the  
x

x
plates  
x

x
and  
x

x
glasses. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
all  
x

x
stay  
x

x
to  
x

x
supper?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
politest  
x

x
unpressing  
x

x
tones. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Of  
x

x
course!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
after. 
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
shan’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
business  
x

x
till  
x

x
late,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
some  
x

x
music  
x

x
first. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
to  
x

x
clear  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thereupon  
x

x
the  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
important,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stayed  
x

x
talking  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
—  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
tall  
x

x
  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
things. 
x

x
Off  
x

x
they  
x

x
went,  
x

x
not  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
trays,  
x

x
balancing  
x

x
columns  
x

x
of  
x

x
plates,  
x

x
each  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bottle  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top,  
x

x
with  
x

x
one  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
ran  
x

x
after  
x

x
them  
x

x
almost  
x

x
squeaking  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
fright:  
x

x
“please  
x

x
be  
x

x
careful!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
“please,  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
trouble!  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

manage.”  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
started  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing:

And  
x

of

course  
x

x
they

did  
x

x
none  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
things,  
x

x
and  
x

x
everything  
x

x
was  
x

x
cleaned  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
away  
x

x
safe  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
lightning,  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
turning  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kitchen  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
doing. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
fender  
x

x
smoking  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
pipe. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
blowing  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
  
x

x
smoke-rings,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
he  
x

x
told  
x

x
one  
x

x
to  
x

x
go,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
—  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
chimney,  
x

x
or  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
clock  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mantelpiece,  
x

x
or  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
table,  
x

x
or  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
ceiling;  
x

x
but  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
it  
x

x
went  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
quick  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
escape  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
Pop!  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
sent  
x

x
a  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
smoke-ring  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
short  
x

x
  
x

x
clay-pipe  
x

x
straight  
x

x
through  
x

x
each  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin’s. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Gandalfs  
x

x
smoke-ring  
x

x
would  
x

x
go  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
hover  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard’s  
x

x
head. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
cloud  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
already,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dim  
x

x
light  
x

x
it  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
look  
x

x
strange  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
sorcerous. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
stood  
x

x
still  
x

x
and  
x

x
watched  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
loved  
x

x
smoke-rings  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
blushed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
how  
x

x
proud  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
yesterday  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
smoke-rings  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
sent  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wind  
x

x
over  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Now  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
music!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Bring  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
instruments!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
bags  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
back  
x

x
little  
x

x
fiddles;  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Ori  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
out  
x

x
flutes  
x

x
from  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
inside  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
coats;  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
produced  
x

x
a  
x

x
drum  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall;  
x

x
  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
too,  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
clarinets  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
walking-sticks. 
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“Excuse  
x

x
  
x

x
me,  
x

x
I  
x

x
left  
x

x
mine  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
porch!”  
x

x
“Just  
x

x
bring  
x

x
mine  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
viols  
x

x
as  
x

x
big  
x

x
as  
x

x
themselves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
  
x

x
harp  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
green  
x

x
cloth. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
  
x

x
golden  
x

x
harp,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
struck  
x

x
it  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
music  
x

x
began  
x

x
all  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,  
x

x
so  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
and  
x

x
sweet  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
everything  
x

x
else,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
swept  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
into  
x

x
dark  
x

x
lands  
x

x
under  
x

x
strange  
x

x
moons,  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
The  
x

x
Water  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
hobbit-  
x

x
  
x

x
hole  
x

x
under  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dark  
x

x
came  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
room  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
window  
x

x
that  
x

x
opened  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
The  
x

x
Hill;  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
firelight  
x

x
flickered  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
April  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
played  
x

x
on,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
s  
x

x
beard  
x

x
  
x

x
wagged  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dark  
x

x
filled  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
room,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
died  
x

x
  
x

x
down,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
were  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
played  
x

x
on. 
x

x
And  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
first  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
played,  
x

x
deep-  
x

x
  
x

x
throated  
x

x
singing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
deep  
x

x
  
x

x
places  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
homes;  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fragment  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
song,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
like  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
without  
x

x
their  
x

x
music. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Far  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
misty  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
cold  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
dungeons  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
away  
x

x
ere  
x

x
break  
x

x
of  
x

x
day  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

seek

the

x
pale  
x

x
enchanted  
x

gold. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

dwarves

of  
x

yore  
x

x
made  
x

mighty  
x

x
spells,  
x

x
  
x

x
While  
x

x
hammers  
x

x
fell  
x

x
like  
x

x
ringing  
x

x
bells  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
places  
x

x
deep,  
x

x
where  
x

dark  
x

things  
x

sleep,

In

hollowhalls

the

fells. 
x

For

ancient

king

and

elvish

lord  
x

There

a

golden

They

shaped

and

wrought,

and

light

they

The

They

We

away,

ere

of

day,  
x

x

x
To

claim

our

long-forgotten

gold.

Goblets

And

x
There

lay

they

long,

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
a

song

Was

x
sung

unheard

men

elves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

pines

were

roaring

on  
x

x
the

x
height,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
winds  
x

were  
x

x
moaning  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
night. 
x

x
  
x

x
The

fire

red,

it

flaming

spread;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
trees  
x

x
like  
x

x
torches  
x

x
blazed  
x

x
with  
x

x
light. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

bells

were  
x

ringing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dale  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
men

looked  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
faces  
x

x
pale;  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon's  
x

x
ire  
x

x
more  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
than  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
Laid  
x

x
lowtheir

towers

and

frail. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

mountain

smoked

beneath

the

moon;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

x
dmrves,  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the

x
tramp  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
doom. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
fled  
x

x
their  
x

x
hall  
x

x
to  
x

x
dying  
x

x
fall  
x

x

x
Beneath

his

feet,

x
beneath

the

x

x
  
x

x

x

x
Far  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
misty

mountains  
x

x
grim  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
dungeons

deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
dim  
x

x
  
x

x
We

must  
x

x
amy,  
x

x
ere  
x

x
break  
x

x
of  
x

x
day,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
win  
x

x
our  
x

x
harps  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold  
x

x
from  
x

x
him!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
sang  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
felt  
x

x
the  
x

x
love  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
things  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
hands  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
magic  
x

x
moving  
x

x
through  
x

x
him,  
x

x
a  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
jealous  
x

x
love,  
x

x
the  
x

x
desire  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
something  
x

x
Tookish  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
inside  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
pine-trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
waterfalls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
explore  
x

x
the  
x

x
caves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wear  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
sword  
x

x
instead  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
walking-stick. 
x

x
He  
x

x
looked  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
window. 
x

x
The  
x

x
stars  
x

x
were  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
sky  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
shining  
x

x
in  
x

x
dark  
x

x
caverns. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
The  
x

x
Water  
x

x
a  
x

x
flame  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
probably  
x

x
somebody  
x

x
lighting  
x

x
a  
x

x
wood-fire  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
plundering  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
settling  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
and  
x

x
kindling  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
to  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
shuddered;  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
plain  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bag-End,  
x

x
Under-Hill,  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
trembling. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
less  
x

x
than  
x

x
half  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
mind  
x

x
to  
x

x
fetch  
x

x
the  
x

x
lamp,  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
half  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
mind  
x

x
to  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
to,  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
hide  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
beer-barrels  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellar,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
until  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
away. 
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
music  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
singing  
x

x
had  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
looking  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
shining  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
going?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tone  
x

x
that  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
show  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
both  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
halves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
light?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
apologetically. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Dark  
x

x
for  
x

x
dark  
x

x
business!  
x

x
There  
x

x
are  
x

x
many  
x

x
hours  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
dawn.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Of  
x

x
course!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
hurry. 
x

x
He  
x

x
missed  
x

x
the  
x

x
stool  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
fender,  
x

x
  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
poker  
x

x
and  
x

x
shovel  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
crash. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hush!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
speak!”  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
how  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
began. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Gandalf,  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins!  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
met  
x

x
together  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
friend  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
conspirator,  
x

x
this  
x

x
most  
x

x
excellent  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
audacious  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
—  
x

x
may  
x

x
the  
x

x
hair  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
fall  
x

x
out!  
x

x
all  
x

x
praise  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
wine  
x

x
and  
x

x
ale!  
x

x
—  
x

x
”  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
paused  
x

x
for  
x

x
breath  
x

x
and  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
polite  
x

x
remark  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
compliments  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
lost  
x

x
on  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
wagging  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
in  
x

x
protest  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
called  
x

x
audacious  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
worst  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
conspirator,  
x

x
though  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
came  
x

x
out,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
flummoxed. 
x

x
So  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
went  
x

x
on:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
met  
x

x
to

our

ways,

We

soon

before

x
  
x

x
never

return. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
solemn  
x

x
moment. 
x

x
Our  
x

x
object  
x

x
  
x

x
is,  
x

x
I  
x

x
take  
x

x
it,  
x

x
well  
x

x
known  
x

x
to  
x

x
us  
x

x
all. 
x

x
To  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
estimable  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
younger  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
(I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
naming  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
for  
x

x
instance),  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
exact  
x

x
situation  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
may  
x

x
require  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
brief  
x

x
explanation  
x

x
—  
x

x
”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
style. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
important  
x

x
dwarf. 
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
allowed,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
probably  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
on  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
breath,  
x

x
without  
x

x
telling  
x

x
any  
x

x
one  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
anything  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
known  
x

x
already. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
rudely  
x

x
interrupted. 
x

x
Poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
couldn’t  
x

x
bear  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
any  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
At  
x

x
may  
x

x
never  
x

x
return  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
feel  
x

x
a  
x

x
shriek  
x

x
coming  
x

x
up  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
burst  
x

x
out  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
whistle  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
engine  
x

x
coming  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
up,  
x

x
  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
table. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
struck  
x

x
a  
x

x
blue  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
magic  
x

x
staff,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
firework  
x

x
glare  
x

x
the  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
seen  
x

x
kneeling  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
hearth-rug,  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
jelly  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
melting. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
flat  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
calling  
x

x
out  
x

x
“struck  
x

x
by  
x

x
lightning,  
x

x
  
x

x
struck  
x

x
by  
x

x
lightning!”  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
again;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
time. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
laid  
x

x
him  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
drawing-room  
x

x
sofa  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
elbow,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
business. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Excitable  
x

x
little  
x

x
fellow,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
again. 
x

x
“Gets  
x

x
funny  
x

x
queer  
x

x
fits,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
best,  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
—  
x

x
as  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pinch.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
ever  
x

x
seen  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pinch,  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
realize  
x

x
that  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
poetical  
x

x
  
x

x
exaggeration  
x

x
applied  
x

x
to  
x

x
any  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
Old  
x

x
  
x

x
Took’s  
x

x
great-grand-uncle  
x

x
Bullroarer,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
huge  
x

x
(for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit)  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
ride  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
horse. 
x

x
He  
x

x
charged  
x

x
the  
x

x
ranks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mount  
x

x
Gram  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Battle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Green  
x

x
Fields,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
knocked  
x

x
their  
x

x
king  
x

x
Golfimbul’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
clean  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
club. 
x

x
It  
x

x
sailed  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
yards  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit-hole,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
was  
x

x
won  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
game  
x

x
of  
x

x
Golf  
x

x
invented  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
moment. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
Bullroarer’s  
x

x
  
x

x
gentler  
x

x
descendant  
x

x
was  
x

x
reviving  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
drawing-  
x

x
  
x

x
room. 
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
  
x

x
nervously  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
parlour. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard,  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
speaking:  
x

x
“Humph!”  
x

x
(or  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
snort  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
like  
x

x
that). 
x

x
“Will  
x

x
he  
x

x
do,  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
think?  
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
all  
x

x
very  
x

x
well  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
to  
x

x
talk  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
being  
x

x
fierce,  
x

x
but  
x

x
one  
x

x
shriek  
x

x
like  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
of  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
wake  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
relatives,  
x

x
and  
x

x
kill  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
us. 
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
it  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
more  
x

x
like  
x

x
fright  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
excitement!  
x

x
In  
x

x
fact,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
sign  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
sure  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
wrong  
x

x
house. 
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
clapped  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
bobbing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
mat,  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
my  
x

x
doubts. 
x

x
He  
x

x
looks  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
grocer  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
turned  
x

x
the  
x

x
handle  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
in. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Took  
x

x
side  
x

x
had  
x

x
won. 
x

x
He  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
go  
x

x
without  
x

x
bed  
x

x
and  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
fierce. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
little  
x

x
fellowbobbing  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mat  
x

x
it  
x

x
almost  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
really  
x

x
fierce. 
x

x
Many  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
part  
x

x
regretted  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself:  
x

x
“Bilbo,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool;  
x

x
you  
x

x
walked  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
foot  
x

x
in  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Pardon  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“if  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
overheard  
x

x
  
x

x
words  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
saying. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
understand  
x

x
what  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
talking  
x

x
about,

or  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
reference  
x

x
to  
x

x
burglars,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I

I

am

right

in  
x

x
believing”  
x

x
(this  
x

is  
x

x
what  
x

he  
x

x
called

on

his

dignity)

“that

I

am

no

good.

x
I

x
will  
x

x
show  
x

x
  
x

x
you. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
signs  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
door  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
painted  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
week  
x

x
ago

—

,

I

am

quite

sure

x
you

have

come

to

the

house.

x
As

x
soon  
x

as  
x

x
I

saw  
x

x
  
x

x
your

x
funny

x
faces  
x

x
on  
x

x
the

door-step,  
x

x
I

had  
x

x
my

x

x
doubts. 
x

x
But  
x

x
treat  
x

x
it  
x

x
as

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
one. 
x

x
Tell  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
you

want  
x

x
done,

and  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
try  
x

x
it,

x
if  
x

x
I

x
have

to

walk

the

I

x
  
x

x
“Yes,  
x

x
yes,

but  
x

that

was

long

ago,”

said

x
  
x

x
Gloin. 
x

x
“I

talking

about

you.

I

you

good

job,

of

can

Treasure-hunter

instead

of

you

like.

Some

of

do.

It’s

all

the

same

to

us. 
x

Gandalf

told

us

that

was

and

that

he

had

arranged

for

x
a

x
meeting  
x

x
here  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
Wednesday

tea-time.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
a

mark,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“I

x

put

it

there

myself.

For  
x

x
very  
x

x
good  
x

x
reasons. 
x

x
You  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the

fourteenth  
x

man  
x

x
for  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
expedition,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
chose  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
let  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
one  
x

x
say  
x

x
I

x
chose

the

x
wrong

man

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

wrong

house,

and  
x

x
you

can  
x

x
stop  
x

x
at  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
bad  
x

x
luck  
x

x
you  
x

x
like,  
x

x
or  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
digging  
x

x
coal.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
scowled  
x

x
so  
x

x
angrily  
x

x
at  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
chair;  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
open  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
a  
x

x
question,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
frowned  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
bushy  
x

x
eyebrows,  
x

x
till  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
tight  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
snap. 
x

x
“That’s  
x

x
right,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“Let’s  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
argument. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
chosen  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

be  
x

x
enough

for  
x

x
all

of  
x

x
  
x

x
you. 
x

x
If  
x

x
I  
x

x
say  
x

x
he

is

a  
x

x
Burglar,  
x

x
a  
x

x
Burglar  
x

he

is,

or  
x

will  
x

be

when

the

time

comes.

There

is

a

x
lot

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
in  
x

x
him  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
guess,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
he

has  
x

any

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

himself. 
x

x
You

may

(possibly)

x
all

x
live  
x

x
to

thank  
x

me  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
boy,  
x

x
fetch  
x

x
the  
x

x
lamp,  
x

x
and  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
this!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
On  
x

x
the  
x

x
table  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
lamp  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
red  
x

x
shade  
x

x
he  
x

x
spread  
x

x
a  
x

x
piece  
x

x
of  
x

x
parchment  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
map. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This

he

in

answer

to  
x

the

dwarves’  
x

x

excited

questions.

“It

a

“I

this

us

much,”

said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
disappointedly  
x

after  
x

x
a

glance. 
x

x
“I

remember

the

Mountain  
x

well

enough

the

lands

about

it.

And

I

know

where

Mirkwood

x

x
say  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
runes,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
creep  
x

x
into  
x

x
a

x
hole  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
size,  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
young  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
not  
x

x
after  
x

x
devouring  
x

x
so  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
seems  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
big  
x

x
hole  
x

x
to  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
squeaked  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
(who  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
experience  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
of  
x

x
hobbit-holes). 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
excited  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
interested  
x

x
again,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
shut. 
x

x
He  
x

x
loved  
x

x
maps,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
hung  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Country  
x

x
Round  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
favourite  
x

x
walks  
x

x
marked  
x

x
on  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
red  
x

x
  
x

x
ink. 
x

x
“How  
x

x
could  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
door  
x

x
be  
x

x
kept  
x

x
  
x

x
secret  
x

x
from  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
outside,  
x

x
apart  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
remember. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“In  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
ways,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
this  
x

x
one  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
we  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
see. 
x

x
From  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
says  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
map  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
guess  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
closed  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
made  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
exactly  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
usual  
x

x
dwarves’  
x

x
  
x

x
method  
x

x
—  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
right,  
x

x
isn’t  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Quite  
x

x
right,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Also,”  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
“I  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
to  
x

x
mention  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
map  
x

x
went  
x

x
a  
x

x
key,  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
curious  
x

x
key. 
x

x
Here  
x

x
it  
x

x
is!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
and  
x

x
handed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
a  
x

x
key  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
and  
x

x
intricate  
x

x
  
x

x
wards,  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
silver. 
x

x
“Keep  
x

x
it  
x

x
safe!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Indeed  
x

x
I  
x

x
will,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
fastened  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
upon  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
chain  
x

x
that  
x

x
hung  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
neck  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
under  
x

x
his  
x

x
jacket. 
x

x
“Now  
x

x
things  
x

x
begin  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
hopeful. 
x

x
This  
x

x
news  
x

x
alters  
x

x
them  
x

x
much  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
better. 
x

x
So  
x

x
far  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
clear  
x

x
idea  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
to  
x

x
do. 
x

x
We  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
going  
x

x
East,  
x

x
as  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
careful  
x

x
as  
x

x
we  
x

x
could,  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
would  
x

x
begin  
x

x
—  
x

x
.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
that,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
know  
x

x
anything  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
roads  
x

x
East,”  
x

x
interrupted  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
might  
x

x
go

from

there  
x

x
up  
x

x
along  
x

x
the

River  
x

x
  
x

x
Running,”  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
taking  
x

x
no  
x

x
notice,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruins  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
town  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
there,  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
we  
x

x
none  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
liked  
x

x
the  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
The  
x

x
river  
x

x
runs  
x

x
right  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
South  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
out

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
of

it

comes  
x

the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
too  
x

x
—  
x

x
far  
x

x
too  
x

x
often,  
x

x
  
x

x
unless  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
changed  
x

x
his  
x

x
habits.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
good,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
  
x

x
“not  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
Warrior,  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
Hero. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
one;  
x

x
but  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
are  
x

x
busy  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
in  
x

x
distant  
x

x
lands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
neighbourhood  
x

x
heroes  
x

x
are  
x

x
scarce,  
x

x
or  
x

x
simply  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
found. 
x

x
Swords  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
parts  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
blunt,  
x

x
and  
x

x
axes  
x

x
are  
x

x
used  
x

x
for  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
shields  
x

x
as  
x

x
cradles  
x

x
or  
x

x
dish-covers;  
x

x
and  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
comfortably  
x

x
far-off  
x

x
(and  
x

x
therefore  
x

x
  
x

x
legendary). 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why  
x

x
I  
x

x
settled  
x

x
on  
x

x
burglary—  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
the  
x

x
existence  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
Side-door. 
x

x
And  
x

x
here  
x

x
is  
x

x
our  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar,  
x

x
the  
x

x
chosen  
x

x
and  
x

x
selected  
x

x
  
x

x
burglar. 
x

x
So  
x

x
now  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
make  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
plans.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well  
x

x
then,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“supposing  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
burglar-expert  
x

x
gives  
x

x
us  
x

x
some  
x

x
ideas  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
suggestions.”  
x

x
He  
x

x
turned  
x

x
with  
x

x
mock-politeness  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“First  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
like  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
things,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he,  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
all  
x

x
confused  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
  
x

x
shaky  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
but  
x

x
so  
x

x
far  
x

x
still  
x

x
Tookishly  
x

x
  
x

x
determined  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
things. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
mean  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
that,  
x

x
and  
x

x
how  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
there,  
x

x
and  
x

x
who  
x

x
it  
x

x
belongs  
x

x
to,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
further.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bless  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“haven’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
got  
x

x
a

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
map?  
x

and  
x

x
didn’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
hear  
x

x
our  
x

x
song?  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
we  
x

x
been  
x

x
talking  
x

x
about

all

this

for

hours?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“All

the

I

should

like

it

all

plain

clear,”

said

he  
x

obstinately,

putting

on  
x

x
his

business

manner

(usually

for

people

forth”  
x

x
—  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
meant:  
x

x
“What

am

I

going

alive?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Long  
x

x
ago  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
grandfather  
x

x
Thror’s  
x

x
time  
x

x
our  
x

x
family  
x

x
was  
x

x
driven  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
North,  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
with  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
tools

x
to  
x

x
this  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
map. 
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
ancestor,  
x

x
Thrain  
x

x
the  
x

x
Old,  
x

x
but  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
mined  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
tunnelled  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
huger  
x

x
halls  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
greater  
x

x
workshops  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
addition  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
believe  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
many  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
too. 
x

x
Anyway  
x

x
they  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
immensely  
x

x
rich  
x

x
and  
x

x
famous,  
x

x
and  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
grandfather  
x

x
was  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
treated  
x

x
with  
x

x
great  
x

x
reverence  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mortal  
x

x
men,  
x

x
who  
x

x
lived  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
South,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
gradually  
x

x
spreading  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
overshadowed  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
built  
x

x
the  
x

x
merry  
x

x
town  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
days. 
x

x
Kings  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
send  
x

x
for  
x

x
our  
x

x
smiths,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
reward  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
least  
x

x
skillful  
x

x
most  
x

x
richly. 
x

x
  
x

x
Fathers  
x

x
would  
x

x
beg  
x

x
us  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
their  
x

x
sons  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
apprentices,  
x

x
and  
x

x
pay  
x

x
us  
x

x
handsomely,  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
in  
x

x
food-supplies,  
x

x
which  
x

x
we  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
bothered  
x

x
to  
x

x
grow  
x

x
or  
x

x
find  
x

x
for  
x

x
ourselves. 
x

x
  
x

x
Altogether  
x

x
those  
x

x
were  
x

x
good  
x

x
days  
x

x
for  
x

x
us,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
poorest  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
had  
x

x
money  
x

x
to  
x

x
spend  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
lend,  
x

x
and  
x

x
leisure  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
things  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
fun  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
speak  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
marvellous  
x

x
and  
x

x
magical  
x

x
toys,  
x

x
the  
x

x
like  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
found  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
now-a-days. 
x

x
So  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
grandfather’s  
x

x
halls  
x

x
became  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
armour  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
and  
x

x
carvings  
x

x
and  
x

x
cups,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
toy  
x

x
  
x

x
market  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Undoubtedly  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
what  
x

x
brought  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
Dragons  
x

x
steal  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
know,  
x

x
from  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
find  
x

x
them;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
guard  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
plunder  
x

x
as  
x

x
long  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
live  
x

x
(which  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
practically  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
killed),  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
enjoy  
x

x
a  
x

x
brass  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
they  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
work  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
usually  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
notion  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
current  
x

x
  
x

x
market  
x

x
value;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
thing  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
themselves,  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
mend  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
loose  
x

x
scale  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
armour. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days,  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold  
x

x
was  
x

x
probably  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
scarce  
x

x
up  
x

x
there,  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
flying  
x

x
  
x

x
south  
x

x
or  
x

x
getting  
x

x
killed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
general  
x

x
waste  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
destruction  
x

x
that  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
make  
x

x
going  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
bad  
x

x
to  
x

x
worse. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
specially  
x

x
  
x

x
greedy,  
x

x
strong  
x

x
and  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
worm  
x

x
called  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
  
x

x
One  
x

x
day  
x

x
he  
x

x
flew  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
south. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
first  
x

x
we  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
noise  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
hurricane  
x

x
coming  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
pine-  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
creaking  
x

x
and  
x

x
cracking  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
who  
x

x
happened  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
outside  
x

x
(I  
x

x
was  
x

x
one  
x

x
luckily  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
  
x

x
adventurous  
x

x
lad  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days,  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
saved  
x

x
my  
x

x
life  
x

x
that  
x

x
day)  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
well,  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
way  
x

x
off  
x

x
we  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
settle  
x

x
on  
x

x
our  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
spout  
x

x
of  
x

x
flame. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
reached  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
By  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
bells  
x

x
were  
x

x
ringing  
x

x
in  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
were  
x

x
arming. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
great  
x

x
gate;  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
them. 
x

x
None  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
that  
x

x
way. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
river  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
steam  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
fog  
x

x
fell  
x

x
on  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
fog  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
destroyed  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
usual  
x

x
  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
story,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
common  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
days. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
crept  
x

x
in  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
routed  
x

x
out  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
halls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lanes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
tunnels,  
x

x
alleys,  
x

x
cellars,  
x

x
mansions  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
passages. 
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
left  
x

x
  
x

x
alive  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
Probably,  
x

x
for  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragons’  
x

x
way,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
piled  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
heap  
x

x
far  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
sleeps  
x

x
on  
x

x
it  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
bed. 
x

x
Later  
x

x
he  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
crawl  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
come  
x

x
by  
x

x
night  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
and  
x

x
carry  
x

x
away  
x

x
people,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
  
x

x
maidens,  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
until  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
was  
x

x
ruined,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
dead  
x

x
or  
x

x
gone. 
x

x
What  
x

x
goes  
x

x
on  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
for  
x

x
certain,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
one  
x

x
lives  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
now-a-days. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
few  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
well  
x

x
outside  
x

x
sat  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wept  
x

x
in  
x

x
hiding,  
x

x
and  
x

x
cursed  
x

x
Smaug;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
unexpectedly  
x

x
joined  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
father  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
my  
x

x
grandfather  
x

x
with  
x

x
singed  
x

x
beards. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
very  
x

x
grim  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
said  
x

x
very  
x

x
little. 
x

x
When  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
how  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
away,  
x

x
they  
x

x
told  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
hold  
x

x
my  
x

x
tongue,  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
proper  
x

x
time  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
know. 
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
away,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
earn  
x

x
our  
x

x
livings  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
best  
x

x
we  
x

x
could  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands,  
x

x
often  
x

x
  
x

x
enough  
x

x
sinking  
x

x
as  
x

x
low  
x

x
as  
x

x
blacksmith-work  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
coalmining. 
x

x
But  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
never  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

x
stolen  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
And  
x

x
even  
x

x
now,  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
allow  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
bit  
x

x
laid  
x

x
by  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
not

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
badly  
x

x
off’  
x

x
—  
x

x
here  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
stroked  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
chain  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
his  
x

x
neck  
x

x
—  
x

x
“we  
x

x
still  
x

x
mean  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
it  
x

x
back,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
our  
x

x
curses  
x

x
home  
x

x
to  
x

x
Smaug  
x

—

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
can. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
often  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
about  
x

x
my

x
father’s  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
my

grandfather’s

x
escape. 
x

x
I  
x

x
see  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
had

a

private  
x

x
Side-door  
x

which  
x

only  
x

x

they

knew  
x

x
about. 
x

x
But  
x

x
apparently  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
map,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
like  
x

to  
x

x
know  
x

x
how  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
hold  
x

of  
x

x
it,

x
and  
x

x
why

it

did

not

x
come

down

to

me,

“I

of

I

it,”

the

of

true,”

you;

you

hardly

blame

the

I

Bilbo

The

explanation

“Your

the

wizard

slowly

and

grimly,

“gave

a

he

never

near

How

I

I

“Whatever

you

doing

there?”

asked

Thorin

with

a

shudder,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
shivered. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Never

you

mind.

I

was

finding

things

out,

a

nasty

dangerous

business

it

was.

x
Even

I,

Gandalf,

only

just

escaped.

I

it

wandering,

the

Moria,”

Thorin;

“we

all

again

from

the

The

thing

x
your

father

The

the

Mountain

more

tasks

for

you!”  
x

x

“Hear,

hear!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
accidentally  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

it  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hear  
x

x
what?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
said  
x

x
turning  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
flustered  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
“Hear  
x

x
what  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
say!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What’s  
x

x
that?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
East  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
look  
x

x
round. 
x

x
After  
x

x
all  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Side-door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
must  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
  
x

x
sometimes,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose. 
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
door-  
x

x
  
x

x
step  
x

x
long  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
I  
x

x
daresay  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
something. 
x

x
And  
x

x
well,  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
know,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
talked  
x

x
long  
x

x
enough  
x

x
for  
x

x
one  
x

x
night,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
what  
x

x
I  
x

x
mean. 
x

x
What  
x

x
about  
x

x
bed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
an  
x

x
early  
x

x
  
x

x
start,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
that?  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
you  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
before  
x

x
you  
x

x
go.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Before  
x

x
we  
x

x
go,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
mean,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Aren’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar?  
x

x
And  
x

x
isn’t  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
door-step  
x

x
your  
x

x
job,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
speak  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
door?  
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
agree  
x

x
about  
x

x
bed  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
breakfast. 
x

x
I  
x

x
like  
x

x
six  
x

x
eggs  
x

x
with  
x

x
my  
x

x
ham,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
starting  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
journey:  
x

x
fried  
x

x
not  
x

x
poached,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
mind  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
break  
x

x
’em.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
had  
x

x
ordered  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
breakfasts  
x

x
without  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
please  
x

x
(which  
x

x
  
x

x
annoyed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
very  
x

x
much),  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
got  
x

x
up. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
room  
x

x
for  
x

x
them  
x

x
all,  
x

x
and  
x

x
filled  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
spare-rooms  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
beds  
x

x
on  
x

x
chairs  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
sofas,  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
stowed  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
little  
x

x
bed  
x

x
very  
x

x
tired  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
  
x

x
happy. 
x

x
One  
x

x
thing  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
make  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
bother  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
up  
x

x
very  
x

x
early  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cook  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
else’s  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
breakfast. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
Tookishness  
x

x
was  
x

x
wearing  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
quite  
x

x
so  
x

x
sure  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
journey  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
in  
x

x
bed  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
humming  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
bedroom  
x

x
next  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
him:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Far  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
misty  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
cold  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
dungeons  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
away,  
x

x
ere  
x

x
break  
x

x
of  
x

x
day,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

find

our

long-forgotten  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
gave  
x

x
him  
x

x
very  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
dreams. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
break  
x

x
of  
x

x
day,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up.

ROAST  
x

x
MUTTON  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Up  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
putting  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
dressing-  
x

x
  
x

x
gown  
x

x
went  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dining-room. 
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
nobody,  
x

x
but  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
signs  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
and  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
  
x

x
breakfast. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
fearful  
x

x
mess  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
room,  
x

x
and  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
unwashed  
x

x
crocks  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
kitchen. 
x

x
Nearly  
x

x
every  
x

x
pot  
x

x
and  
x

x
pan  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
possessed  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
used. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
washing-up  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
dismally  
x

x
real  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
forced  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
the  
x

x
party  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
bad  
x

x
dreams,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
hoped. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
relieved  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
gone  
x

x
without  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
without  
x

x
bothering  
x

x
to  
x

x
wake  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
(“but  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
never  
x

x
a  
x

x
thank-you”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought);  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
help  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
just  
x

x
a  
x

x
trifle  
x

x
  
x

x
disappointed. 
x

x
The  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don't  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
“thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
outlandish  
x

x
nonsense  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
age!”  
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
apron,  
x

x
lit  
x

x
fires,  
x

x
boiled  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
washed  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
nice  
x

x
little  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
kitchen  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
turning  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
dining-room. 
x

x
By  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
was  
x

x
shining;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
front  
x

x
door  
x

x
was  
x

Bilbo

began

to

whistle

about

the

x
In

fact

he

was

just

when

in

walked

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My

said

he,

“whenever

Baggins

in

x

x

x

“Great

Elephants!”

Gandalf,

Gandalf,

he

out;

leaving

his

breakfast

half-finished

quite

unwashed-up,

pushing

his

keys

into

Gandalf

s

hands,

as

his

down

lane,

past

the

great  
x

x
Mill,

across  
x

The

Water,

and

then  
x

on  
x

x
for  
x

x
a

x
  
x

x
mile  
x

x
or  
x

x
more. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Very  
x

x
puffed  
x

x
he

was,

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bywater  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
stroke  
x

x
of  
x

x
eleven,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
pocket-handkerchief!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bravo!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
standing  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
inn

x
door  
x

looking  
x

x
out  
x

x
for  
x

x
him.

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
then  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
came  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
corner  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
village. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
each  
x

x
pony  
x

x
was  
x

x
slung  
x

x
about  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
kinds  
x

x
of  
x

x
baggages,  
x

x
packages,  
x

x
parcels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
paraphernalia. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
small  
x

x
pony,  
x

x
  
x

x
apparently  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Up  
x

x
you  
x

x
two  
x

x
get,  
x

x
and  
x

x
off  
x

x
we  
x

x
go!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I'm  
x

x
awfully  
x

x
sorry,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“but  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
without  
x

x
my  
x

x
hat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
left  
x

x
my  
x

x
pocket-  
x

x
  
x

x
handkerchief  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
haven't  
x

x
got  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
money. 
x

x
I  
x

x
didn't  
x

x
get  
x

x
your  
x

x
note  
x

x
until  
x

x
after  
x

x
10.45  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
precise.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don't  
x

x
be  
x

x
precise,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dwalin,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
don't  
x

x
  
x

x
worry!  
x

x
You  
x

x
will  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
manage  
x

x
without  
x

x
pocket-  
x

x
  
x

x
handkerchiefs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
many  
x

x
other  
x

x
things,  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
you  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
journey’s  
x

x
end. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hat,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
a  
x

x
spare  
x

x
hood  
x

x
and  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
luggage.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That's  
x

x
how  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
start,  
x

x
jogging  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
inn  
x

x
one  
x

x
fine  
x

x
morning  
x

x
just  
x

x
before  
x

x
May,  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
laden  
x

x
ponies;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
wearing  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark-  
x

x
  
x

x
green  
x

x
hood  
x

x
(a  
x

x
little  
x

x
weather-stained)  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
dark-green  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
borrowed  
x

x
from  
x

x
Dwalin. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
large  
x

x
for  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
rather  
x

x
  
x

x
comic. 
x

x
What  
x

x
his  
x

x
father  
x

x
Bungo  
x

x
would  
x

x
have

x
of  
x

x
him,  
x

x
I  
x

x
daren't  
x

x
think. 
x

x
His  
x

x
only  
x

x
comfort  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
he  
x

x
couldn't  
x

x
be  
x

x
mistaken  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
beard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
riding  
x

x
very  
x

x
long,  
x

x
when  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
very  
x

x
splendid  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
white  
x

x
horse. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
pocket-handkerchiefs,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo's  
x

x
pipe  
x

x
and  
x

x
tobacco. 
x

x
So  
x

x
after  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
party  
x

x
went  
x

x
along  
x

x
very  
x

x
merrily,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
stories  
x

x
or  
x

x
sang  
x

x
songs  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
forward  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
day,  
x

x
except  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
meals. 
x

x
These  
x

x
didn't  
x

x
come  
x

x
quite  
x

x
as  
x

x
often  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
them,  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
that  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
bad  
x

x
after  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
first  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
through  
x

x
hobbit-  
x

x
  
x

x
lands,  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
respectable  
x

x
country  
x

x
inhabited  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
decent  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
with  
x

x
good  
x

x
roads,  
x

x
an  
x

x
inn  
x

x
or  
x

x
two,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
farmer  
x

x
ambling  
x

x
by  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
business. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
lands  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
strangely,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sang  
x

x
songs  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
before. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lone-lands,  
x

x
where  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
left,  
x

x
no  
x

x
inns,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
roads  
x

x
grew  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
  
x

x
worse. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
far  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
were  
x

x
dreary  
x

x
hills,  
x

x
rising  
x

x
  
x

x
higher  
x

x
and  
x

x
higher,  
x

x
dark  
x

x
with  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
On  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
old  
x

x
castles  
x

x
with  
x

x
an  
x

x
evil  
x

x
look,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
built  
x

x
by  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
people. 
x

x
  
x

x
Everything  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
gloomy,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
weather  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
had  
x

x
taken  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
turn. 
x

x
Mostly  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
good  
x

x
as  
x

x
May  
x

x
can  
x

x
be,  
x

x
can  
x

x
be,  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
merry  
x

x
  
x

x
tales,  
x

x
but  
x

x
now  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
wet. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lone-  
x

x
  
x

x
lands  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
obliged  
x

x
to  
x

x
camp  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could,  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
dry. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“To  
x

x
think  
x

x
it  
x

x
will  
x

x
soon  
x

x
be  
x

x
June!”  
x

x
grumbled  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
splashed  
x

x
along  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
muddy  
x

x
track. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
after  
x

x
tea-time;  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
pouring  
x

x
with  
x

x
rain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
all  
x

x
day;  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
was  
x

x
dripping  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
his  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
water;  
x

x
the  
x

x
pony  
x

x
was  
x

x
tired  
x

x
and  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
stones;  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
grumpy  
x

x
to  
x

x
talk. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
  
x

x
I'm  
x

x
sure  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
has  
x

x
got  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dry  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
food-bags,”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Bother  
x

x
  
x

x
burgling  
x

x
and  
x

x
everything  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
it!  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
home  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
nice  
x

x
hole  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
kettle  
x

x
just  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing!”  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished  
x

x
that!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
jogged  
x

x
on,  
x

x
never  
x

x
turning  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
or  
x

x
taking  
x

x
any  
x

x
notice  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
Somewhere  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
down,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
valley  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom. 
x

x
Wind  
x

x
got  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
willows  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
its  
x

x
banks  
x

x
bent  
x

x
and  
x

x
sighed. 
x

x
Fortunately  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
over  
x

x
an  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
stone  
x

x
bridge,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
swollen  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
rains,  
x

x
came  
x

x
rushing  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
and  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
north. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
night  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
  
x

x
over. 
x

x
The  
x

x
wind  
x

x
broke  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
clouds,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
moon  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
flying  
x

x
rags. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
muttered  
x

x
something  
x

x
about  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
get  
x

x
a  
x

x
dry  
x

x
patch  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
on?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
until  
x

x
then  
x

x
did  
x

x
they  
x

x
notice  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
missing. 
x

x
So  
x

x
far  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
them,  
x

x
never  
x

x
saying  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
or  
x

x
merely  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
them  
x

x
company  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
while. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
most,  
x

x
talked  
x

x
most,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
most. 
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
simply  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
all!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Just  
x

x
when  
x

x
a  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
useful,  
x

x
too,”  
x

x
groaned  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
and  
x

x
Nori  
x

x
(who  
x

x
shared  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit's  
x

x
views  
x

x
about  
x

x
regular  
x

x
meals,  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
often). 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
decided  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
camp  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
were. 
x

x
They  
x

x
moved  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
clump  
x

x
of  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
drier  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
shook  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
drip,  
x

x
drip,  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
annoying. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mischief  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
Dwarves  
x

x
can  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
almost  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
almost  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
wind  
x

x
or  
x

x
no  
x

x
wind;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
do  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
night,  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gloin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
specially  
x

x
good  
x

x
at  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
took  
x

x
fright  
x

x
at  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
bolted. 
x

x
He  
x

x
got  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
catch  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
again,  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
were  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
drowned,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
baggage  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
carried  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
washed  
x

x
away  
x

x
off  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
  
x

x
food,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
little  
x

x
left  
x

x
for  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
less  
x

x
for  
x

x
breakfast. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
sat  
x

x
glum  
x

x
and  
x

x
wet  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
muttering,  
x

x
while  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
quarrelling  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
sadly  
x

x
reflecting  
x

x
that  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
all  
x

x
pony-  
x

x
  
x

x
rides  
x

x
in  
x

x
May-sunshine,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
their  
x

x
look-out  
x

x
man,  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“There's  
x

x
a  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
there!”  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
hill  
x

x
some  
x

x
way  
x

x
off  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
on  
x

x
it,  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
thick  
x

x
in  
x

x
parts. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
mass  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
now  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
shining,  
x

x
a  
x

x
reddish  
x

x
comfortable-looking  
x

x
light,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
or  
x

x
torches  
x

x
twinkling. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
it  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
while,  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
fell  
x

x
to  
x

x
arguing. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
said  
x

x
“no”  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
“yes”. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
said  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
but  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
see,  
x

x
and  
x

x
anything  
x

x
was  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
little  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
  
x

x
less  
x

x
breakfast,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wet  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
night. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Others  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“These  
x

x
parts  
x

x
are  
x

x
none  
x

x
too  
x

x
well  
x

x
  
x

x
known,  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
too  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
  
x

x
Travellers  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
come  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
now. 
x

x
The  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
maps  
x

x
are  
x

x
no  
x

x
use:  
x

x
things  
x

x
have  
x

x
changed  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
worse  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
is  
x

x
unguarded. 
x

x
They  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
even  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
round  
x

x
here,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
less  
x

x
inquisitive  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
along,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
less  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
find.”  
x

x
Some  
x

x
said:  
x

x
  
x

x
“After  
x

x
all  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
fourteen  
x

x
of  
x

x
us.”  
x

x
Others  
x

x
said:  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
has  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
got  
x

x
to?”  
x

x
This  
x

x
remark  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
repeated  
x

x
by  
x

x
everybody. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
pour  
x

x
down  
x

x
worse  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
fight. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
settled  
x

x
it. 
x

x
“After  
x

x
all  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
with  
x

x
us,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said;  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
off,  
x

x
leading  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
(with  
x

x
all  
x

x
due  
x

x
and  
x

x
proper  
x

x
  
x

x
caution)  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
light. 
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
soon  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
went;  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
proper  
x

x
path  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
seen,  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
might  
x

x
lead  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
house  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
farm;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
do  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
rustling  
x

x
and  
x

x
crackling  
x

x
and  
x

x
creaking  
x

x
(and  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
and  
x

x
drafting),  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
pitch  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
red  
x

x
light  
x

x
shone  
x

x
out  
x

x
very  
x

x
bright  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree-trunks  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
ahead. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar’s  
x

x
turn,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
meaning  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
must  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
out  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
that  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
for,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
all  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
perfectly  
x

x
safe  
x

x
and  
x

x
canny,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
“Now  
x

x
scuttle  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
quick,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
is  
x

x
well. 
x

x
If  
x

x
not,  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
can!  
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
can't,  
x

x
hoot  
x

x
twice  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
barn-owl  
x

x
and  
x

x
once  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
screech-owl,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
do  
x

x
what  
x

x
we  
x

x
can.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Off  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
go,  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
explain  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
hoot  
x

x
even  
x

x
once  
x

x
like  
x

x
any  
x

x
kind  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
owl  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
fly  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
bat. 
x

x
But  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
can  
x

x
move  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
in  
x

x
woods,  
x

x
absolutely  
x

x
  
x

x
quietly. 
x

x
They  
x

x
take  
x

x
a  
x

x
pride  
x

x
in  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
sniffed  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
once  
x

x
at  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
called  
x

x
“all  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarvish  
x

x
racket,”  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
along,  
x

x
though  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
or  
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
  
x

x
anything  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
windy  
x

x
night,  
x

x
not  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
  
x

x
cavalcade  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
two  
x

x
feet  
x

x
off. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
walking  
x

x
primly  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
red  
x

x
light,  
x

x
I  
x

x
don't  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
weasel  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
whisker  
x

x
at  
x

x
it. 
x

x
So,  
x

x
naturally,  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
right  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fire  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
fire  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
—  
x

x
without  
x

x
disturbing  
x

x
anyone. 
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Three  
x

x
very  
x

x
large  
x

x
persons  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
round  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
large  
x

x
fire  
x

x
of  
x

x
beech-logs. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
toasting  
x

x
mutton  
x

x
on  
x

x
long  
x

x
spits  
x

x
of  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
licking  
x

x
the  
x

x
gravy  
x

x
off  
x

x
their  
x

x
fingers. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fine  
x

x
toothsome  
x

x
smell. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
drink  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
drinking  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
jugs. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
trolls. 
x

x
Obviously  
x

x
trolls. 
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
sheltered  
x

x
life,  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
that:  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
faces  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
theirsize,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shape  
x

x
oftheirlegs,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
mention  
x

x
their  
x

x
language,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
drawing-  
x

x
  
x

x
room  
x

x
fashion  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Mutton  
x

x
yesterday,  
x

x
mutton  
x

x

x

x

tomorrer,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Never

x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
second. 
x

x
“What

x

x
he  
x

said  
x

x
jogging  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elbow  
x

x
of  
x

x
William,  
x

who  
x

x
was  
x

x
taking  
x

x
a  
x

x
pull

x

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
William  
x

x
choked. 
x

x
“Shut  
x

x
yer

mouth!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x

as

x
soon  
x

as

he

could.

“Yer

x

x
He  
x

x
took  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
bite  
x

x
off  
x

x
a  
x

x
sheep's  
x

x
leg  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
roasting,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wiped  
x

x
his  
x

x
lips  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
sleeve. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Yes,  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
afraid

x
trolls

x
do

x
behave

like

that,

x
  
x

even  
x

x
those

x
with  
x

x
only  
x

x
one

head

x
each. 
x

x
After  
x

x
  
x

x
hearing  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
at  
x

x
once. 
x

x
Either  
x

x
he  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
and  
x

x
warned  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
three  
x

x
fair-sized  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
  
x

x
mood,  
x

x
quite  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
try  
x

x
roasted  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
or  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
pony,  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
change;  
x

x
or  
x

x
else  
x

x
he  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
good  
x

x
quick  
x

x
burgling. 
x

x
A  
x

x
really  
x

x
first-class  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
legendary  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
would  
x

x
at  
x

x
this  
x

x
point  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
picked  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls’  
x

x
pockets  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
worth  
x

x
while,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
manage  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
,  
x

x
pinched  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
mutton  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
spits,  
x

x
purloined  
x

x
the  
x

x
beer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
walked  
x

x
off  
x

x
without  
x

x
their  
x

x
noticing  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Others  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
practical  
x

x
but  
x

x
with  
x

x
less  
x

x
professional  
x

x
pride  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
have  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
a  
x

x
dagger  
x

x
into  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
observed  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
spent  
x

x
cheerily. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
knew  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
read  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
things  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
or  
x

x
done. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
alarmed,  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
disgusted;  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
miles  
x

x
away,  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
somehow  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
straight  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Company  
x

x
emptyhanded. 
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
stood  
x

x
and  
x

x
hesitated  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
various  
x

x
burglarious  
x

x
proceedings  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
picking  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls'  
x

x
pockets  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
the  
x

x
least  
x

x
  
x

x
difficult,  
x

x
so  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrel. 
x

x
William  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
having  
x

x
another  
x

x
drink. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
plucked  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
courage  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
hand  
x

x
in  
x

x
William's  
x

x
  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
pocket. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
purse  
x

x
in  
x

x
it,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
big  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
bag  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Ha!”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he,  
x

x
  
x

x
warming  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
new  
x

x
work  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
it  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
  
x

x
out,  
x

x
“this  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
beginning!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was!  
x

x
Trolls'  
x

x
purses  
x

x
are  
x

x
the  
x

x
mischief,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
exception. 
x

x
“’Ere,  
x

x
'oo  
x

x
are  
x

x
you?”  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
squeaked,  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
pocket;  
x

x
and  
x

x
William  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
round  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
and  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
neck,  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
duck  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Blimey,  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
look  
x

x
what  
x

x
I’ve  
x

x
copped!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
is  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
coming  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Lumme,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
knows!  
x

x
What  
x

x
are  
x

x
yer?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
a  
x

x
bur  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
poor  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
all  
x

x
over,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
how  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
owl-noises  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
throttled  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
burrahobbit?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
they  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
startled. 
x

x
  
x

x
Trolls  
x

x
are  
x

x
slow  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
uptake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
  
x

x
suspicious  
x

x
about  
x

x
anything  
x

x
new  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What's  
x

x
a  
x

x
burrahobbit  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
pocket,  
x

x
anyways?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
can  
x

x
yer  
x

x
cook  
x

x
'em?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yer  
x

x
can  
x

x
try,"  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
picking  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
skewer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He  
x

x
wouldn't  
x

x
make  
x

x
above  
x

x
a  
x

x
mouthful,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
William,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
already  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
  
x

x
“not  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
skinned  
x

x
and  
x

x
boned.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“P'raps  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
more  
x

x
like  
x

x
him  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
might  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
pie,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Here  
x

x
you,  
x

x
are  
x

x
there  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x

nassty  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
rabbit,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit's  
x

x
furry  
x

x
feet;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
picked  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
toes  
x

x
and  
x

x
shook  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes,  
x

x
lots,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
give  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
away. 
x

x
“No  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
not  
x

x
one,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
  
x

x
afterwards. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
d'yer  
x

x
mean?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
holding  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
way  
x

x
up,  
x

x
bythe  
x

x
hairthis  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
I  
x

x
say,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
gasping. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
  
x

x
please  
x

x
don't  
x

x
cook  
x

x

I

I’ll

perfectly

beautiful

breakfast

you  
x

x
  
x

x
won't

have  
x

x
me  
x

x
for  
x

x
supper.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
blighter,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
already  
x

x
had  
x

x
as  
x

x
much  
x

x
supper  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
hold;  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
beer. 
x

x
“Poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
blighter!  
x

x
Let  
x

x
him  
x

x
go!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Not  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
says  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
means  
x

x
by  
x

x
lots  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,"  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
don't  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
throat  
x

x
cut  
x

x
in  
x

x
me  
x

x
sleep!  
x

x
Hold  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
talks!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
have  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
caught  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
anyway.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You're  
x

x
a  
x

x
fat  
x

x
fool,  
x

x
William,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
“as  
x

x
  
x

x
I've  
x

x
said  
x

x
afore  
x

x
this  
x

x
evening.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
you're  
x

x
a  
x

x
lout!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
I  
x

x
won't  
x

x
take  
x

x
that  
x

x
from  
x

x
you,  
x

x
Bill  
x

x
  
x

x
Huggins,”  
x

x
says  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
and  
x

x
puts  
x

x
his  
x

x
fist  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
William's  
x

x
eye. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
gorgeous  
x

x
row. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
enough  
x

x
wits  
x

x
left,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
to  
x

x
scramble  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
like  
x

x
dogs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
calling  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
all  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
of  
x

x
perfectly  
x

x
true  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
applicable  
x

x
names  
x

x
in  
x

x
very  
x

x
loud  
x

x
voices. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
locked  
x

x
in  
x

x
one  
x

x
another’s  
x

x
arms,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
kicking  
x

x
and  
x

x
thumping,  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
whacked  
x

x
at  
x

x
them  
x

x
both  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
branch  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
senses  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
only  
x

x
made  
x

x
them  
x

x
madder  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
left. 
x

x
But  
x

x
his  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
feet  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
squashed  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bert's  
x

x
big  
x

x
paw,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
breath  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
body,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
round;  
x

x
so  
x

x
there  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
panting,  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
outside  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
of  
x

x
firelight. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Right  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fight  
x

x
up  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
noises  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
back,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
hoot  
x

x
like  
x

x
an  
x

x
owl,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
started  
x

x
off  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
to  
x

x
creep  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could. 
x

x
No  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
did  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
awful  
x

x
howl. 
x

x
Trolls  
x

x
simply  
x

x
detest  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
(uncooked). 
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bill  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
immediately,  
x

x
and  
x

x
“a  
x

x
sack,  
x

x
Tom,  
x

x
quick!”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was,  
x

x
knew  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
happening,  
x

x
a  
x

x
sack  
x

x
was  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
head,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There's  
x

x
more  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
yet,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom,  
x

x
“or  
x

x
  
x

x
I'm  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
mistook. 
x

x
Lots  
x

x
and  
x

x
none  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“No  
x

x
burrahobbits,  
x

x
but  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
here  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
That's  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
shape  
x

x
of  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
reckon  
x

x
you’re  
x

x
right,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
we’d  
x

x
  
x

x
best  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
light.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
did. 
x

x
With  
x

x
sacks  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hands,  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
used  
x

x
for  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
off  
x

x
mutton  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
plunder,  
x

x
they  
x

x
waited  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
As  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spilled  
x

x
jugs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
gnawed  
x

x
mutton,  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
surprise,  
x

x
pop!  
x

x
went  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
smelly  
x

x
sack  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
head,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
down. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
lay  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
together,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Nori  
x

x
and  
x

x
Ori  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
heap,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
piled  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortably  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That’ll  
x

x
teach  
x

x
'em,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom;  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
trouble,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fought  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
[ike  
x

x
mad,  
x

x
as  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
will  
x

x
when  
x

x
cornered. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
came  
x

x
last  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
caught  
x

x
  
x

x
unawares. 
x

x
He  
x

x
came  
x

x
expecting  
x

x
mischief,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
didn't  
x

x
need  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends'  
x

x
legs  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
sacks  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
him  
x

x
that  
x

x
things  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
all  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
stood  
x

x
outside  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
some  
x

x
way  
x

x
off,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“What's  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
trouble?  
x

x
Who  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
my  
x

x
people  
x

x
about?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It's  
x

x
trolls!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
him. 
x

x
“They’re  
x

x
  
x

x
hiding  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
bushes  
x

x
with  
x

x
sacks,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O!  
x

x
are  
x

x
they?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
  
x

x
forward  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
leap  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
caught  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
branch  
x

x
all  
x

x
on  
x

x
fire  
x

x
at  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
end:  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
got  
x

x
that  
x

x
end  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
eye  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
step  
x

x
aside. 
x

x
That  
x

x
put  
x

x
him  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
did  
x

x
his  
x

x
best. 
x

x
He  
x

x
caught  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Tom’s  
x

x
leg  
x

x
—  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
thick  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
young  
x

x
tree-trunk  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
sent  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
bushes,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
  
x

x
kicked  
x

x
the  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
Thorin's  
x

x
face. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Trolls  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
got  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
teeth  
x

x
for  
x

x
that,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lost  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
front  
x

x
ones. 
x

x
It  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
howl,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you. 
x

x
But  
x

x
just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
William  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
behind  
x

x
and  
x

x
popped  
x

x
a  
x

x
sack  
x

x
right  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin's  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes. 
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fight  
x

x
ended. 
x

x
A  
x

x
nice  
x

x
pickle  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
now:  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
neatly  
x

x
tied  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
sacks,  
x

x
with  
x

x
three  
x

x
angry  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
  
x

x
(and  
x

x
two  
x

x
with  
x

x
burns  
x

x
and  
x

x
bashes  
x

x
to  
x

x
remember)  
x

x
  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
by  
x

x
them,  
x

x
arguing  
x

x
whether  
x

x
they  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
roast  
x

x
them  
x

x
slowly,  
x

x
or  
x

x
mince  
x

x
them  
x

x
fine  
x

x
and  
x

x
boil  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
or  
x

x
just  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
squash  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
into  
x

x
jelly;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
bush,  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
skin  
x

x
torn,  
x

x
not  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
move  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
fear  
x

x
they  
x

x
should  
x

x
hear  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
then  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
came  
x

x
back. 
x

x
But  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
saw  
x

x
him. 
x

x
The  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
decided  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
roast  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
eat  
x

x
them  
x

x
later  
x

x
—  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bert's  
x

x
idea,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
argument  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
agreed  
x

x
to  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
good  
x

x
roasting  
x

x
'em  
x

x
now,  
x

x
it'd  
x

x
take  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
night,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
Bert  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
William's. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don't  
x

x
start  
x

x
the  
x

x
argument  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
again,  
x

x
  
x

x
Bill,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“or  
x

x
it  
x

x
wll  
x

x
take  
x

x
all  
x

x
night.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who's  
x

x
a-arguing?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William,  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
spoken. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You’re  
x

x
a  
x

x
liar,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William;  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
argument  
x

x
began  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
again. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
decided  
x

x
to  
x

x
mince  
x

x
them  
x

x
fine  
x

x
and  
x

x
boil  
x

x
them. 
x

x
So  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
black  
x

x
pot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
knives. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
good  
x

x
boiling  
x

x
'em!  
x

x
We  
x

x
ain't  
x

x
got  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it's  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
well  
x

x
and  
x

x
all,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
William  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
Tom’s. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Shut  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
they,  
x

x
“or  
x

x
we'll  
x

x
never  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
done. 
x

x
And  
x

x
yer  
x

x
can  
x

x
fetch  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
yerself,  
x

x
if  
x

x
yer  
x

x
  
x

x
say  
x

x
any  
x

x
more.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Shut  
x

x
up  
x

x
yerself!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom,  
x

x
who  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
William's  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“Who’s  
x

x
arguing  
x

x
but  
x

x
you,  
x

x
I’d  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
to  
x

x
know.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You’re  
x

x
a  
x

x
booby,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Booby  
x

x
yerself!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
the  
x

x
argument  
x

x
began  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
again,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
hotter  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
until  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
decided  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
sacks  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
squash  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
boil  
x

x
them  
x

x
next  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
first?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Better  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
first,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert,  
x

x
  
x

x
whose  
x

x
eye  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
damaged  
x

x
by  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
was  
x

x
talking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don't  
x

x
talk  
x

x
to  
x

x
yerself!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
wants  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
one,  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Which  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
he?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
one  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
stockings,"  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Nonsense,  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
  
x

x
stockings,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice  
x

x
like  
x

x
William's. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
made  
x

x
sure  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
yellow,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yellow  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Then  
x

x
what  
x

x
did  
x

x
yer  
x

x
say  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
grey  
x

x
for?”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
never  
x

x
did. 
x

x
Tom  
x

x
said  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
did!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Two  
x

x
to  
x

x
one,  
x

x
so  
x

x
shut  
x

x
yer  
x

x
mouth!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bert. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
a-talkin'  
x

x
to?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
stop  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
together. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
night's  
x

x
gettin’  
x

x
on,  
x

x
and  
x

x
dawn  
x

x
comes  
x

x
early. 
x

x
  
x

x
Let's  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dawn  
x

x
take  
x

x
you  
x

x
all,  
x

x
and  
x

x
be  
x

x
stone  
x

x
to  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice  
x

x
that  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
like  
x

x
William’s. 
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
wasn't. 
x

x
For  
x

x
just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
twitter  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches. 
x

x
William  
x

x
never  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
stone  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
stooped;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
were  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
like  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
And  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
stand  
x

x
to  
x

x
this  
x

x
day,  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
  
x

x
unless  
x

x
the  
x

x
birds  
x

x
perch  
x

x
on  
x

x
them;  
x

x
for  
x

x
trolls,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
probably  
x

x
know,  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
underground  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
dawn,  
x

x
or  
x

x
they  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
stuff  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
made  
x

x
of,  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
move  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
and  
x

x
William. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Excellent!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
and  
x

x
helped  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
climb  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
thorn-bush. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
understood. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard's  
x

x
voice  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
bickering  
x

x
and  
x

x
quarrelling,  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
came  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
an  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
thing  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
untie  
x

x
the  
x

x
sacks  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
suffocated,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
annoyed:  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
enjoyed  
x

x
  
x

x
lying  
x

x
there  
x

x
listening  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
making  
x

x
plans  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
roasting  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
squashing  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
mincing  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear  
x

x
Bilbo's  
x

x
account  
x

x
of  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
twice  
x

x
over,  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
satisfied. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Silly  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
practising  
x

x
pinching  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pocket-picking,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
“when  
x

x
what  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
was  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
food!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
that’s  
x

x
just  
x

x
what  
x

x
you  
x

x
wouldn't  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
fellows  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
struggle,  
x

x
in  
x

x
any  
x

x
case,”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“Anyhow  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
wasting  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Don't  
x

x
you  
x

x
realize  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
cave  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
hole  
x

x
dug  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
near  
x

x
to  
x

x
hide  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
in?  
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
look  
x

x
into  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
searched  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
marks  
x

x
of  
x

x
trolls'  
x

x
stony  
x

x
boots  
x

x
going  
x

x
away  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
They  
x

x
followed  
x

x
the  
x

x
tracks  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill,  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
by  
x

x
bushes  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone  
x

x
leading  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
cave. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
open  
x

x
it,  
x

x
not  
x

x
though  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
tried  
x

x
various  
x

x
incantations. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Would  
x

x
this  
x

x
be  
x

x
any  
x

x
good?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
getting  
x

x
tired  
x

x
and  
x

x
angry. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
had  
x

x
their  
x

x
fight.”  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
held  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
largish  
x

x
key,  
x

x
though  
x

x
no  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
  
x

x
William  
x

x
had  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
very  
x

x
small  
x

x
and  
x

x
secret. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
pocket,  
x

x
very  
x

x
luckily,  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
didn't  
x

x
you  
x

x
mention  
x

x
it  
x

x
before?”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
it  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
keyhole. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone  
x

x
door  
x

x
swung  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
one  
x

x
big  
x

x
push,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

x
inside. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
bones  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
smell  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air;  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
food  
x

x
jumbled  
x

x
carelessly  
x

x
on  
x

x
shelves  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
among  
x

x
an  
x

x
untidy  
x

x
litter  
x

x
of  
x

x
plunder,  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
from  
x

x
brass  
x

x
buttons  
x

x
to  
x

x
pots  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
  
x

x
coins  
x

x
standing  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
clothes,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls  
x

x
—  
x

x
too  
x

x
small  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
trolls,  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
they  
x

x
belonged  
x

x
to  
x

x
victims  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
several  
x

x
swords  
x

x
of  
x

x
various  
x

x
  
x

x
makes,  
x

x
shapes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sizes. 
x

x
Two  
x

x
caught  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
particularly,  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
  
x

x
scabbards  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewelled  
x

x
hilts. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
each  
x

x
took  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
these;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
knife  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
leather  
x

x
sheath. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
made  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
pocket-knife  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
troll,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
as  
x

x
good  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
sword  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“These  
x

x
look  
x

x
like  
x

x
good  
x

x
blades,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
half  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
curiously. 
x

x
“They  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
any  
x

x
troll,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
any  
x

x
smith  
x

x
among  
x

x
men  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
parts  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
days;  
x

x
but  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
read  
x

x
the  
x

x
runes  
x

x
on  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
know  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
them.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Let's  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
smell!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
carried  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
pots  
x

x
of  
x

x
coins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
food  
x

x
as  
x

x
was  
x

x
untouched  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
fit  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
also  
x

x
one  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
of  
x

x
ale  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
full. 
x

x
By  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
felt  
x

x
like  
x

x
breakfast,  
x

x
and  
x

x
being  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
turn  
x

x
their  
x

x
noses  
x

x
up  
x

x
at  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls’  
x

x
larder. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
provisions  
x

x
were  
x

x
very  
x

x
scanty. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
bread  
x

x
and  
x

x
cheese,  
x

x
and  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
of  
x

x
ale,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
toast  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
embers  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
slept,  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
night  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
disturbed;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
more  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
afternoon. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
brought  
x

x
up  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
carried  
x

x
away  
x

x
the  
x

x
pots  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
and  
x

x
buried  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
very  
x

x
secretly  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
track  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
river,  
x

x
putting  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
many  
x

x
spells  
x

x
over  
x

x
them,  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
case  
x

x
they  
x

x
ever  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
chance  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
recover  
x

x
them. 
x

x
When  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
done,  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
mounted  
x

x
once  
x

x
more,  
x

x
and  
x

x
jogged  
x

x
along  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
East. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
did  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
to,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
ask?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
along. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“To  
x

x
look  
x

x
ahead,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
what  
x

x
brought  
x

x
you  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
nick  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
time?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Looking  
x

x
behind,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Exactly!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
could  
x

x
you  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
plain?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
spy  
x

x
out  
x

x
our  
x

x
road. 
x

x
It  
x

x
will  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
become  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
and  
x

x
difficult. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
anxious  
x

x
about  
x

x
replenishing  
x

x
our  
x

x
small  
x

x
stock  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
provisions. 
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
gone  
x

x
very  
x

x
far,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
met  
x

x
a  
x

x
couple  
x

x
of  
x

x
friends  
x

x
of  
x

x
mine  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
Rivendell.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where's  
x

x
that?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don't  
x

x
interrupt!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
days  
x

x
now,  
x

x
if  
x

x
we’re  
x

x
lucky,  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
As  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
saying  
x

x
I  
x

x
met  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Elrond's  
x

x
people. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
along  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
fear  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
they  
x

x
who  
x

x
told  
x

x
me  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
three  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
and  
x

x
settled  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
road:  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
everyone  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
district,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
waylaid  
x

x
strangers. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
back. 
x

x
Looking  
x

x
behind  
x

x
I  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
distance  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
it. 
x

x
So  
x

x
now  
x

x
you  
x

x
know. 
x

x
  
x

x
Please  
x

x
be  
x

x
more  
x

x
careful,  
x

x
next  
x

x
time,  
x

x
or  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
get  
x

x
anywhere!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thank  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin.

A  
x

x
SHORT  
x

x
REST  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
sing  
x

x
or  
x

x
tell  
x

x
stories  
x

x
that  
x

x
day,

even

though

the

weather

improved;

day,

nor

the

day

after. 
x

x
They

had  
x

begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
danger  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
side. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
camped  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
horses  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
than  
x

x
they

x
had;  
x

x
for  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
bags,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
with  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
from  
x

x
the

trolls.

morning  
x

x
they  
x

x
forded  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
  
x

x
place  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
stones  
x

x
and  
x

x
foam. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
bank  
x

x
was  
x

x
steep  
x

x
and  
x

x
slippery. 
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
leading  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
had  
x

x
marched  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
near  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
they  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
day’s  
x

x
easy  
x

x
journey  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
feet  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
nearest. 
x

x
  
x

x
Dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
drear  
x

x
it  
x

x
looked,  
x

x
though  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
patches  
x

x
of  
x

x
sunlight  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
brown  
x

x
sides,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
its  
x

x
shoulders  
x

x
the  
x

x
tips  
x

x
of  
x

x
snow-peaks  
x

x
  
x

x
gleamed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Is  
x

x
that  
x

x
The  
x

x
Mountain?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
solemn  
x

x
voice,  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
round  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
a  
x

x
thing  
x

x
that  
x

x
looked  
x

x
so  
x

x
big  
x

x
  
x

x
before. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
not!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
“That  
x

x
is  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
through,  
x

x
or  
x

x
over,  
x

x
or  
x

x
under  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
somehow,  
x

x
before  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
Wilderland  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond. 
x

x
And  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
way  
x

x
even  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
East  
x

x
where  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
lies  
x

x
on  
x

x
our  
x

x
treasure.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
more  
x

x
tired  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
ever  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
before. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
once  
x

x
again  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
chair  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
favourite  
x

x
  
x

x
sitting-room  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hobbit-hole,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kettle  
x

x
  
x

x
singing. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
time!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
led  
x

x
the  
x

x
way. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
must  
x

x
not  
x

x
miss  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
road,  
x

x
or  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
done  
x

x
for,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
need  
x

x
food,  
x

x
for  
x

x
one  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
rest  
x

x
in  
x

x
reasonable  
x

x
  
x

x
safety  
x

x
—  
x

x
also  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
very  
x

x
necessary  
x

x
to  
x

x
tackle  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
proper  
x

x
path,  
x

x
or  
x

x
else  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
lost  
x

x
in  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
start  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
again  
x

x
(if  
x

x
you  
x

x
ever  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
at  
x

x
all).”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
asked  
x

x
him  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
making  
x

x
for,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
answered:  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild,  
x

x
as  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
you  
x

x
may  
x

x
know. 
x

x
  
x

x
Hidden  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
fair  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
of  
x

x
Rivendell  
x

x
where  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
lives  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
House. 
x

x
I  
x

x
sent  
x

x
a  
x

x
message  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
friends,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
expected.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
nice  
x

x
and  
x

x
comforting,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
got  
x

x
there  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
easy  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
sounds  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
House  
x

x
west  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountains. 
x

x
There  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
valleys  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
hills  
x

x
to  
x

x
break  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
only  
x

x
one  
x

x
vast  
x

x
slope  
x

x
going  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
the  
x

x
feet  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain,  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
land  
x

x
the  
x

x
colour  
x

x
of  
x

x
heather  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
crumbling  
x

x
rock,  
x

x
with  
x

x
patches  
x

x
and  
x

x
slashes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
grass-green  
x

x
and  
x

x
moss-green  
x

x
showing  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
might  
x

x
be. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Morning  
x

x
passed,  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
came;  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
silent  
x

x
waste  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
dwelling. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
growing  
x

x
anxious,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
now  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
almost  
x

x
  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
between  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
unexpected  
x

x
valleys,  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
steep  
x

x
sides,  
x

x
that  
x

x
opened  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
looked  
x

x
down  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
below  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
running  
x

x
water  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
gullies  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
almost  
x

x
leap  
x

x
  
x

x
over,  
x

x
but  
x

x
very  
x

x
deep  
x

x
with  
x

x
waterfalls  
x

x
in  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
dark  
x

x
ravines  
x

x
that  
x

x
one  
x

x
could  
x

x
neither  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
jump  
x

x
over  
x

x
nor  
x

x
climb  
x

x
into. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
bogs,  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
green  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
places  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
at,  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
growing  
x

x
bright  
x

x
and  
x

x
tall;  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
pony  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
walked  
x

x
there  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
pack  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
back  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
a  
x

x
much  
x

x
wider  
x

x
land  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ford  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
guessed. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
astonished. 
x

x
The  
x

x
only  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
marked  
x

x
with  
x

x
white  
x

x
stones,  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
small,  
x

x
and  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
half  
x

x
covered  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
moss  
x

x
or  
x

x
heather. 
x

x
Altogether  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
slow  
x

x
  
x

x
business  
x

x
following  
x

x
the  
x

x
track,  
x

x
even  
x

x
guided  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
beard  
x

x
wagged  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
stones,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
his  
x

x
lead,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
no  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
search  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
day  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
fail. 
x

x
Tea-time  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
gone  
x

x
by,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
  
x

x
supper-time  
x

x
would  
x

x
soon  
x

x
do  
x

x
the  
x

x
same. 
x

x
There  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
moths  
x

x
fluttering  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
became  
x

x
very  
x

x
dim,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
risen. 
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
pony  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
stumble  
x

x
over  
x

x
roots  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
stones. 
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
steep  
x

x
fall  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
so  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gandalfs  
x

x
horse  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
slope. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Here  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
at  
x

x
last!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
called,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
valley  
x

x
far  
x

x
below. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
voice  
x

x
of  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
water  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
bed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bottom;  
x

x
the  
x

x
scent  
x

x
of  
x

x
trees  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
light  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley-side  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
never  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
slithered  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dusk  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
steep  
x

x
zig-zag  
x

x
  
x

x
path  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
valley  
x

x
of  
x

x
Rivendell. 
x

x
The  
x

x
air  
x

x
  
x

x
grew  
x

x
warmer  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
lower,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
smell  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
pine-trees  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
drowsy,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
every  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
he  
x

x
nodded  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
fell  
x

x
off,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
his  
x

x
nose  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
pony’s  
x

x
neck. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
  
x

x
spirits  
x

x
rose  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
down. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
changed  
x

x
to  
x

x
beech  
x

x
and  
x

x
oak,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
twilight. 
x

x
The  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
green  
x

x
had  
x

x
almost  
x

x
faded  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
at  
x

x
length  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
open  
x

x
glade  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
banks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hmmm!  
x

x
it  
x

x
smells  
x

x
like  
x

x
elves!”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
up  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
burning  
x

x
bright  
x

x
and  
x

x
blue. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
then  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
burst  
x

x
of  
x

x
song  
x

x
like  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
O!  
x

x
What  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
doing,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
going?  
x

x
  
x

x
Your  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
need  
x

x
shoeing!  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
river  
x

x
is  
x

x
flowing!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
O!  
x

x
tra-la-la-lally  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
O!  
x

x
What  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
seeking,  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
making?  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
faggots  
x

x
are  
x

x
reeking,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
bannocks  
x

x
are  
x

x
baking!  
x

x
  
x

x
0!  
x

x
tril-lil-lil-lolly  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
is  
x

x
jolly,  
x

x
  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
0!  
x

x
Where  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
going  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
beards  
x

x
all  
x

x
a-wagging?  
x

x
  
x

x
No  
x

x
knowing,  
x

x
no  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
  
x

x
What  
x

x
brings  
x

x
Mister  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
June  
x

x
  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
0!  
x

x
Will  
x

x
you  
x

x
be  
x

x
staying,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Or  
x

x
will  
x

x
you  
x

x
be  
x

x
flying?  
x

x
  
x

x
Your  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
are  
x

x
straying!  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
daylight  
x

x
is  
x

x
dying!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
fly  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
folly,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
stay  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
jolly  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
listen  
x

x
and  
x

x
hark  
x

x
  
x

x
Till  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
our  
x

x
tune  
x

x
  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
ha!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
and  
x

x
sang  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
fair  
x

x
nonsense  
x

x
I  
x

x
daresay  
x

x
you  
x

x
think  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
care;  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
only  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
more  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
so. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
caught  
x

x
glimpses  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
deepened. 
x

x
He  
x

x
loved  
x

x
elves,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
met  
x

x
them;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
too. 
x

x
Dwarves  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
decent  
x

x
enough  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
think  
x

x
them  
x

x
foolish  
x

x
  
x

x
(which  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
foolish  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
think),  
x

x
or  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
annoyed  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
For  
x

x
some  
x

x
elves  
x

x
tease  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
at  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
beards. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“Just  
x

x
look!  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
pony,  
x

x
my  
x

x
dear!  
x

x
Isn’t  
x

x
it  
x

x
delicious!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Most  
x

x
astonishing  
x

x
wonderful!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
off  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
into  
x

x
another  
x

x
song  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
ridiculous  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
written  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
full. 
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
one,  
x

x
a  
x

x
tall  
x

x
young  
x

x
fellow,  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowed  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Welcome  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thank  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
gruffly;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
already  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
horse  
x

x
and  
x

x
among  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves,  
x

x
talking  
x

x
merrily  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
way,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf:  
x

x
  
x

x
“that  
x

x
is,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x

path

across

the

water

to  
x

the

house  
x

beyond. 
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
set  
x

x
you  
x

x
right,  
x

x
but  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
best  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
foot,  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
you

are

over

the

bridge. 
x

x
Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
stay  
x

x
a

bit

x
and  
x

x
sing  
x

x
with  
x

x
us,  
x

x
or  
x

x
will  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
straight  
x

x
  
x

x
on?  
x

x
Supper  
x

x
is  
x

x
preparing  
x

x
over  
x

x
there,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
smell  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood-fires  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
cooking.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Tired  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
stay  
x

x
a  
x

x
while. 
x

x
Elvish  
x

x
singing  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
miss,  
x

x
in  
x

x
June  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars,  
x

x
not  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
care  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
things. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
few  
x

x
private  
x

x
words  
x

x
with  
x

x
these  
x

x
people  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
his  
x

x
names  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
although  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
them  
x

x
before. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
their  
x

x
opinion  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
interesting. 
x

x
Elves  
x

x
know  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
wondrous  
x

x
  
x

x
folk  
x

x
for  
x

x
news,  
x

x
and  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
among  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
peoples  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
land,  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
water  
x

x
flows,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
quicker. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
for  
x

x
supper  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
possible  
x

x
just  
x

x
then,  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
stay. 
x

x
On  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went,  
x

x
leading  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
path  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
brink  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
flowing  
x

x
fast  
x

x
and  
x

x
noisily,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
mountain-streams  
x

x
do  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
summer  
x

x
evening,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
sun  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
all  
x

x
day  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
snow  
x

x
far  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
above. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
parapet,  
x

x
as  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
pony  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
walk  
x

x
on;  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
go,  
x

x
slow  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
careful,  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one,  
x

x
each  
x

x
leading  
x

x
his  
x

x
pony  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridle. 
x

x
The  
x

x
elves  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
bright  
x

x
  
x

x
lanterns  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
sang  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
party  
x

x
went  
x

x
across. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
dip  
x

x
your  
x

x
beard  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
foam,  
x

x
father!”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
cried  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
bent  
x

x
almost  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
and  
x

x
knees. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
long  
x

x
enough  
x

x
without  
x

x
  
x

x
watering  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Mind  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
doesn’t  
x

x
eat  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
cakes!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
called. 
x

x
"He  
x

x
is  
x

x
too  
x

x
fat  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
through  
x

x
key-holes  
x

x
  
x

x
yet!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hush,  
x

x
hush!  
x

x
Good  
x

x
People!  
x

x
and  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
night!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
came  
x

x
last. 
x

x
“Valleys  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
elves  
x

x
have  
x

x
over  
x

x
merry  
x

x
  
x

x
tongues. 
x

x
Good  
x

x
night!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
House,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
its  
x

x
doors  
x

x
flung  
x

x
wide. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
strange  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
but  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
and  
x

x
days  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
good  
x

x
to  
x

x
spend  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
soon  
x

x
told  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
to  
x

x
listen  
x

x
to;  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
uncomfortable,  
x

x
palpitating,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
gruesome,  
x

x
may  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
tale,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
take  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
telling  
x

x
anyway. 
x

x
They  
x

x
stayed  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
good  
x

x
house,  
x

x
fourteen  
x

x
days  
x

x
at  
x

x
least,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
it  
x

x
hard  
x

x
to  
x

x
leave. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
gladly  
x

x
have  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
there  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever  
x

x
and  
x

x
ever  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
supposing  
x

x
a  
x

x
wish  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
taken  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
without  
x

x
trouble. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
little  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
about  
x

x
their  
x

x
stay. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
master  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
elf-friend  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
people  
x

x
whose

fathers  
x

came

into

the

strange

stories

before

the

of

the

goblins

and  
x

x
the

elves

and  
x

x
the  
x

x
first

men

x
in

the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
In  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
days  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
tale  
x

x
there  
x

were  
x

still  
x

x
some

people

who

had

both

elves

and

heroes  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
for  
x

x

ancestors,

and

x
Elrond

x
the  
x

x
master  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
their

chief. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

as  
x

x
noble  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
fair  
x

x
in  
x

x
face  
x

x
as  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
elf-lord,  
x

x
as  
x

x
strong  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
warrior,  
x

x
as  
x

x
wise  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard,

as

venerable  
x

x
as

x
a

king  
x

x
of

dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
kind  
x

x
as  
x

x
summer. 
x

x
He  
x

x
comes  
x

x
into  
x

x
many  
x

x
tales,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
his  
x

x
part  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
story  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
is  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
one,  
x

x
though  
x

x
important,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
see,  
x

x
if  
x

x
we

ever  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
the

end  
x

of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
house  
x

x
was  
x

x
perfect,  
x

x
whether  
x

x
you  
x

x
liked  
x

x
food,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

sleep,

x
or  
x

x
work,

x
or  
x

x
story-telling,  
x

x
or  
x

x
singing,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
and  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
best,

or  
x

x
a

pleasant  
x

x

mixture

of

them

all.

x
not

come

into

x
that

x
valley. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tales  
x

x
or  
x

x
one  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
songs  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
house. 
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
as  
x

x
well,  
x

x
  
x

x
grew  
x

x
refreshed  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
days  
x

x
there. 
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
were  
x

x
mended  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
bruises,  
x

x
their  
x

x
tempers  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
hopes. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
  
x

x
bags  
x

x
were  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
food  
x

x
and  
x

x
provisions  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
but  
x

x
strong  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
them  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
passes. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
plans  
x

x
were  
x

x
improved  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
advice. 
x

x
So  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
midsummer  
x

x
eve,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
early  
x

x
sun  
x

x
on  
x

x
midsummer  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
knew  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
runes  
x

x
of  
x

x
every  
x

x
kind. 
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
day  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
swords  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls’  
x

x
lair,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“These  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
troll-make. 
x

x
They  
x

x
are  
x

x
old  
x

x
swords,  
x

x
very  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
swords  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
High  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
West,  
x

x
my  
x

x
kin. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
made  
x

x
in  
x

x
Gondolin  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
Goblin-  
x

x
  
x

x
wars. 
x

x
They  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
or  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
plunder,  
x

x
for  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
destroyed  
x

x
that  
x

x
city  
x

x
many  
x

x
ages  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
  
x

x
This,  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
the  
x

x
runes  
x

x
name  
x

x
Orcrist,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Goblin-  
x

x
  
x

x
cleaver  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
tongue  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gondolin;  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
famous  
x

x
blade. 
x

x
This,  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
was  
x

x
Glamdring,  
x

x
  
x

x
Foe-hammer  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gondolin  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
wore. 
x

x
Keep  
x

x
them  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Whence  
x

x
did  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
get  
x

x
them,  
x

x
I  
x

x
wonder?”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
with  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
interest. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
say,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Elrond,  
x

x
“but  
x

x
one  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
guess  
x

x
that  
x

x
your  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
had  
x

x
plundered  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
plunderers,  
x

x
or  
x

x
come  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
remnants  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
robberies  
x

x
in  
x

x
some  
x

x
hold  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

that

there

are  
x

still  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
treasures

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
to

be  
x

found  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
deserted  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mines  
x

x
of  
x

x
Moria,  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
and  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
  
x

x
war.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
pondered  
x

x
these  
x

x
words. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
keep  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
sword  
x

x
in  
x

x
honour,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“May  
x

x
it  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
cleave  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
once  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
wish  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
granted  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
enough  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Elrond. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
  
x

x
show  
x

x
me  
x

x
now  
x

x
your  
x

x
map!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
took  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
long  
x

x
at  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
shook  
x

x
his  
x

x
head;  
x

x
for  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
  
x

x
approve  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
love  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
hated  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
cruel  
x

x
wickedness,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
grieved  
x

x
to  
x

x
remember  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruin  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
and  
x

x
its  
x

x
merry  
x

x
bells,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
burned  
x

x
banks  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
bright  
x

x
River  
x

x
Running. 
x

x
The  
x

x
moon  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
shining  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
broad  
x

x
silver  
x

x
crescent. 
x

x
He  
x

x
held  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
map  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
white  
x

x
light  
x

x
shone  
x

x
through  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
is  
x

x
this?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
are  
x

x
moon-letters  
x

x
  
x

x
here,  
x

x
beside  
x

x
the  
x

x
plain  
x

x
runes  
x

x
which  
x

x
say  
x

x
‘five  
x

x
feet  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
three  
x

x
may  
x

x
walk  
x

x
abreast.’”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
are  
x

x
moon-letters?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
excitement. 
x

x
He  
x

x
loved  
x

x
maps,  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
before;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
also  
x

x
liked  
x

x
runes  
x

x
and  
x

x
letters  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
handwriting,  
x

x
though  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
wrote  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
thin  
x

x
and  
x

x
spidery. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Moon-letters  
x

x
are  
x

x
rune-letters,  
x

x
but  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
cannot  
x

see  
x

them,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Elrond,  
x

x
“not

when

you  
x

look

straight

at

them. 
x

x
They

can

only  
x

be

seen

when

the

more

cunning

sort

it

the

shape

season

the  
x

x
  
x

x
day

when

they

were

written. 
x

The

dwarves

invented

them

wrote

them

with

silver

pens,

as

your

friends

tell

These

x

x
  
x

“What

they

say?”  
x

asked

Gandalf

and

x

x
Thorin  
x

x
together,  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
vexed  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
that  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
found  
x

this

out  
x

first,

though

really

there

not

there

another

“Stand

Elrond,

“He  
x

x
was  
x

the

father

of

the

Dwarves,

my

“Then

what

is  
x

x
Durin’s  
x

x
Day?”

asked  
x

Elrond.

“The

day

of

the

dwarves’  
x

x
New  
x

x
Year,”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“is  
x

x
as  
x

x
all  
x

should

know

the

the

of

x

x
Winter. 
x

x
We  
x

x
still  
x

x
call  
x

x
it  
x

x
Durin’s  
x

x
Day  
x

when

the

of

Autumn

the

are  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky  
x

x
  
x

x
together. 
x

x
But  
x

x
this  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
help  
x

x
us  
x

x
much,

I

fear,

for  
x

it

passes  
x

x
our  
x

x
skill  
x

x
in  
x

x
these

x
days  
x

x
to

guess

when  
x

x
  
x

x
such

a

time

will  
x

come  
x

x
again.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
remains  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf.

x
“Is

there  
x

any

more

"None

x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Elrond,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

the

map  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
dance  
x

x
and  
x

x
sing  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
midsummer’s  
x

x
  
x

x
eve. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
midsummer’s  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
as  
x

x
fair  
x

x
and  
x

x
fresh  
x

x
as  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
dreamed:  
x

x
  
x

x
blue  
x

x
sky  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
a

cloud,

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
water. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
away  
x

x
amid  
x

x
songs  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
farewell  
x

x
and  
x

x
good

speed,  
x

x
with  
x

x
their

hearts  
x

x

ready

for  
x

more

adventure,

and

with

a

knowledge

of  
x

the

road

they

must

follow

over

the

Misty

Mountains

IV  
x

x
  
x

x

x
  
x

x
OVER  
x

x
HILL  
x

x
AND  
x

x
UNDER  
x

x
HILL  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
paths  
x

x
that  
x

x
led  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
passes  
x

x
over  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
paths  
x

x
were  
x

x
cheats  
x

x
and  
x

x
deceptions  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
led  
x

x
nowhere  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
bad  
x

x
ends;  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
passes  
x

x
were  
x

x
infested  
x

x
by  
x

x
evil  
x

x
things  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
dangers. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
helped  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
wise  
x

x
advice  
x

x
of  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
knowledge  
x

x
and  
x

x
memory  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
took  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
road  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
pass. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Long  
x

x
days  
x

x
after  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
and  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
House  
x

x
miles  
x

x
  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
going  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
up. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
hard  
x

x
path  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
path,  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
crooked  
x

x
way  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
long. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
look  
x

x
back  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
left,  
x

x
laid  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
far  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Far,  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
West,  
x

x
where  
x

x
things  
x

x
were  
x

x
blue  
x

x
and  
x

x
faint,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
there  
x

x
lay  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
country  
x

x
of  
x

x
safe  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
things,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit-hole. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
shivered. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
cold  
x

x
up  
x

x
here,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
came  
x

x
shrill  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks. 
x

x
Boulders,  
x

x
  
x

x
too,  
x

x
at  
x

x
times  
x

x
came  
x

x
galloping  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain-sides,  
x

x
let  
x

x
loose  
x

x
by  
x

x
mid-day  
x

x
sun  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
snow,  
x

x
and  
x

x
passed  
x

x
among  
x

x
them  
x

x
(which  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
lucky),  
x

x
or  
x

x
over  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
(which  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
alarming). 
x

x
The  
x

x
nights  
x

x
were  
x

x
comfortless  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
chill,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
or  
x

x
talk  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
loud,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
were  
x

x
uncanny,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
silence  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
dislike  
x

x
being  
x

x
broken  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
except  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
water  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wail  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
wind  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
summer  
x

x
is  
x

x
getting  
x

x
on  
x

x
down  
x

x
below,”  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
haymaking  
x

x
is  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
picnics. 
x

x
They  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
harvesting  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
blackberrying,  
x

x
before  
x

x
we  
x

x
even  
x

x
begin  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
at  
x

x
this  
x

x
rate.”  
x

x
And  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
equally  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
thoughts,  
x

x
although  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
said  
x

x
good-bye  
x

x
to  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
midsummer  
x

x
morning,  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
gaily  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
riding  
x

x
swift  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
beyond. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
coming  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
that  
x

x
very  
x

x
next  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
moon  
x

x
of  
x

x
Autumn  
x

x
—  
x

x
“and  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
it  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
Durin’s  
x

x
Day”  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
said. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
shaken  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
Dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
passed  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
years,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
how  
x

x
evil  
x

x
and  
x

x
danger  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
grown  
x

x
and  
x

x
thriven  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild,  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
had  
x

x
driven  
x

x
men  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
had  
x

x
spread  
x

x
in  
x

x
secret  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mines  
x

x
of  
x

x
Moria. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
the  
x

x
good  
x

x
plans  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
wise  
x

x
wizards  
x

x
like  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
good  
x

x
friends  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
go  
x

x
astray  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
on  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
Edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
wise  
x

x
enough  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
something  
x

x
unexpected  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
happen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
hope  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
pass  
x

x
without  
x

x
fearful  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
over  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
tall  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
with  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
peaks  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
valleys  
x

x
where  
x

x
no  
x

x
king  
x

x
ruled. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not. 
x

x
All  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
well,  
x

x
until  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
they  
x

x
met  
x

x
a  
x

x
thunderstorm  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
thunderstorm,  
x

x
a  
x

x
thunder-battle. 
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
know  
x

x
how  
x

x
terrific  
x

x
a  
x

x
really  
x

x
big  
x

x
thunderstorm  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
river-valley;  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
at  
x

x
times  
x

x
when  
x

x
two  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
thunderstorms  
x

x
meet  
x

x
and  
x

x
clash. 
x

x
More  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
  
x

x
still  
x

x
are  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
and  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
night,  
x

x
when  
x

x
storms  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
from  
x

x
East  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
West  
x

x
and  
x

x
make  
x

x
war. 
x

x
The  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
splinters  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
peaks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
shiver,  
x

x
and  
x

x
great  
x

x
crashes  
x

x
  
x

x
split  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
and  
x

x
tumbling  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
every  
x

x
cave  
x

x
and  
x

x
hollow;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
overwhelming  
x

x
noise  
x

x
and  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
light. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
or  
x

x
imagined  
x

x
anything  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kind. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
high  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
  
x

x
place,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
fall  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
dim  
x

x
valley  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
them. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
sheltering  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
a  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
rock  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
a  
x

x
blanket  
x

x
and  
x

x
shook  
x

x
from  
x

x
head  
x

x
to  
x

x
toe. 
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
he  
x

x
peeped  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
lightning-flashes,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone-giants  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
hurling  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
at  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
game,  
x

x
and  
x

x
catching  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
tossing  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
far  
x

x
below,  
x

x
or  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
bits  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bang. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
wind  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
whipped  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hail  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
in  
x

x
every  
x

x
direction,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
an  
x

x
overhanging  
x

x
  
x

x
rock  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
protection  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
drenched  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
standing  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
tails  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
their  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
whinnying  
x

x
with  
x

x
fright. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
giants  
x

x
  
x

x
guffawing  
x

x
and  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountainsides. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
won't  
x

x
do  
x

x
at  
x

x
all!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
blown  
x

x
off,  
x

x
or  
x

x
drowned,  
x

x
or  
x

x
struck  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
lightning,  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
picked  
x

x
up  
x

x
by  
x

x
some  
x

x
giant  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
kicked  
x

x
sky-high  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
football.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Mountain-path  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
of  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
better,  
x

x
take  
x

x
  
x

x
us  
x

x
there!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
grumpy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
happy  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
giants  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
argument  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
sent  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
better  
x

x
shelter. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
very  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
being  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
youngest  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
by  
x

x
some  
x

x
fifty  
x

x
years  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
usually  
x

x
got  
x

x
these  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
jobs  
x

x
(when  
x

x
  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
absolutely  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
use  
x

x
sending  
x

x
Bilbo). 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
looking,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
something  
x

x
(or  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
young  
x

x
dwarves). 
x

x
You  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
  
x

x
usually  
x

x
find  
x

x
something,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
look,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
quite  
x

x
the  
x

x
something  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
after. 
x

x
So  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
proved  
x

x
on  
x

x
this  
x

x
occasion. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
came  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
back,  
x

x
  
x

x
holding  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
dry  
x

x
cave,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“not  
x

x
far  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
next  
x

x
corner;  
x

x
and  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
inside.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Flave  
x

x
you  
x

x
thoroughly  
x

x
explored  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
who  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
caves  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
were  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
unoccupied. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes,  
x

x
yes!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said,  
x

x
though  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
long  
x

x
about  
x

x
it;  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
too  
x

x
quick. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
isn't  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
big,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
far  
x

x
back.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
part  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
caves:  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
how  
x

x
far  
x

x
they  
x

x
go  
x

x
back,  
x

x
  
x

x
sometimes,  
x

x
or  
x

x
where  
x

x
a  
x

x
passage  
x

x
behind  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
lead  
x

x
to,  
x

x
or  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
you  
x

x
inside. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili’s  
x

x
news  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
good  
x

x
enough. 
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
prepared  
x

x
to  
x

x
move. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
wind  
x

x
was  
x

x
howling  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
still  
x

x
growling,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
business  
x

x
getting  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
along. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
go,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
rock  
x

x
  
x

x
standing  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
you  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
low  
x

x
arch  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
room  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
through  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
squeeze,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
unpacked  
x

x
and  
x

x
unsaddled. 
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
passed  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
arch,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
good  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
outside  
x

x
instead  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
safe  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
giants  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
rocks. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
was  
x

x
taking  
x

x
no  
x

x
risks. 
x

x
He  
x

x
lit  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
wand  
x

x
—  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
that  
x

x
day  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
dining-  
x

x
  
x

x
room  
x

x
that  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
so  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
—  
x

x
,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
its  
x

x
light  
x

x
they  
x

x
explored  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cave  
x

x
from  
x

x
end  
x

x
to  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
size,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
too  
x

x
large  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
mysterious. 
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
dry  
x

x
floor  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
nooks. 
x

x
At  
x

x
one  
x

x
end  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
room  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
stood  
x

x
(mighty  
x

x
  
x

x
glad  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
change)  
x

x
steaming,  
x

x
and  
x

x
champing  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
nosebags. 
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
light  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fire  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
to  
x

x
dry  
x

x
their  
x

x
clothes,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
hear  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
spread  
x

x
out  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
wet  
x

x
things  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
got  
x

x
dry  
x

x
ones  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
bundles;  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
their  
x

x
blankets  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable,  
x

x
got  
x

x
out  
x

x
their  
x

x
pipes  
x

x
and  
x

x
blew  
x

x
  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
rings,  
x

x
which  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
turned  
x

x
into  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
colours  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
up  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
amuse  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
talked  
x

x
and  
x

x
talked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
storm,  
x

x
and  
x

x
discussed  
x

x
what  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
(when  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
it,  
x

x
which  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
seem  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
impossible);  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one. 
x

x
And  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
used  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
packages,  
x

x
  
x

x
baggages,  
x

x
tools  
x

x
and  
x

x
paraphernalia  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
turned  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
thing  
x

x
that  
x

x
night  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
with  
x

x
them,  
x

x
after  
x

x
all. 
x

x
For,  
x

x
  
x

x
somehow,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
while;  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
sleep,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
very  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
  
x

x
dreams. 
x

x
He  
x

x
dreamed  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
crack  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave  
x

x
got  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
and  
x

x
bigger,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
wider  
x

x
and  
x

x
wider,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
but  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
call  
x

x
out  
x

x
or  
x

x
do  
x

x
anything  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
lie  
x

x
and  
x

x
look. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
dreamed  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave  
x

x
was  
x

x
giving  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
slipping  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
fall  
x

x
down,  
x

x
down,  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
knows  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
to. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
start,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
dream  
x

x
was  
x

x
true. 
x

x
A  
x

x
crack  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
opened  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
already  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
passage. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies’  
x

x
tails  
x

x
disappearing  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
loud  
x

x
yell,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
loud  
x

x
a  
x

x
yell  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
can  
x

x
give,  
x

x
which  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
surprising  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
size. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Out  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
big  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
ugly-looking  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
before  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
say  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
and  
x

x
blocks. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
six  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
each  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
at  
x

x
least,  
x

x
and  
x

x
two  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
and  
x

x
carried  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack,  
x

x
before  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
say  
x

x
tinder  
x

x
and  
x

x
flint. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
not  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
yell  
x

x
had  
x

x
done  
x

x
that  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
good. 
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
wakened  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
wide  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
second,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
grab  
x

x
him,  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrific  
x

x
flash  
x

x
like  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave,  
x

x
a  
x

x
smell  
x

x
like  
x

x
gunpowder,  
x

x
and  
x

x
several  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
fell  
x

x
dead. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
crack  
x

x
closed  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
snap,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
wrong  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
it!  
x

x
  
x

x
Where  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gandalf?  
x

x
Of  
x

x
that  
x

x
neither  
x

x
they  
x

x
nor  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
had  
x

x
any  
x

x
idea,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
wait  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
out. 
x

x
They  
x

x
seized  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
them  
x

x
along. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
deep,  
x

x
  
x

x
deep,  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
only  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
taken  
x

x
to  
x

x
living  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
through. 
x

x
The  
x

x
passages  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
tangled  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
directions,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
their  
x

x
way,  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
  
x

x
post-office;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
down,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
horribly  
x

x
stuffy. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
rough,  
x

x
and  
x

x
pinched  
x

x
unmercifully,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
chuckled  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
stony  
x

x
  
x

x
voices;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
even  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
troll  
x

x
had  
x

x
picked  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
wished  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
nice  
x

x
bright  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit-hole. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimmer  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
croak,  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
time  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
flap  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
flat  
x

x
feet  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
their  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Clap!  
x

x
Snap!  
x

x
the  
x

x
black  
x

x
crack!  
x

x
  
x

x
Grip,  
x

x
grab!  
x

x
Pinch,  
x

x
nab!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
down  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
Goblin-town  
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
go,

my

Crush,

Hammer

Knocker

and  
x

x
gongs!  
x

x
  
x

x
Pound,

x
pound,

far

underground!  
x

x

x
  
x

x
Ho,

ho!  
x

x
my

lad!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Swish,

smack!  
x

x
Whip  
x

x
crack!  
x

x
  
x

x

x
Batter

and

x

x
Yammer

x
  
x

x
Work,

work!

Nor  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
shirk,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
While  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
quaff,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
laugh,  
x

x
  
x

x
Round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
far  
x

x
underground  
x

x
  
x

x
Below,  
x

x
my  
x

x
lad!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
truly  
x

x
terrifying. 
x

x
The  
x

x
walls  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
clap,  
x

x
snap!  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
crush,  
x

x
smash\  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ugly  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
ho,  
x

x
ho!  
x

x
my  
x

x
lad!  
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
general  
x

x
meaning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
song  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
plain;  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
took  
x

x
out  
x

x
whips  
x

x
and  
x

x
whipped  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
s\nish,  
x

x
smack!,  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
running  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
them;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
already  
x

x
  
x

x
yammering  
x

x
and  
x

x
bleating  
x

x
like  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
cavern. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
lit  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
red  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
torches  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
They  
x

x
all  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
and  
x

x
stamped  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
clapped  
x

x
their  
x

x
hands,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
(with  
x

x
  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
whips)  
x

x
came  
x

x
running  
x

x
in,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-drivers  
x

x
  
x

x
whooped  
x

x
and  
x

x
cracked  
x

x
their  
x

x
whips  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
were  
x

x
already  
x

x
there  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
corner;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
baggages  
x

x
and  
x

x
packages  
x

x
  
x

x
lying  
x

x
broken  
x

x
open,  
x

x
and  
x

x
being  
x

x
rummaged  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
smelt  
x

x
by  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fingered  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
quarrelled  
x

x
over  
x

x
by  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
ever  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
excellent  
x

x
little  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
including  
x

x
a  
x

x
jolly  
x

x
  
x

x
sturdy  
x

x
little  
x

x
white  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
that  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
had  
x

x
lent  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
since  
x

x
his  
x

x
horse  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
suitable  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain-paths. 
x

x
For  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
eat  
x

x
horses  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
donkeys  
x

x
(and  
x

x
other  
x

x
much  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
things),  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
always  
x

x
hungry. 
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
now  
x

x
however  
x

x
the  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
were  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
of  
x

x
themselves. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
chained  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
hands  
x

x
behind  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs  
x

x
and  
x

x
linked  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
line,  
x

x
and  
x

x
dragged  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cavern  
x

x
with  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
tugging  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
row. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
flat  
x

x
stone  
x

x
  
x

x
sat  
x

x
a  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
huge  
x

x
head,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
armed  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
standing  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
the  
x

x
axes  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
bent  
x

x
swords  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
use. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
are  
x

x
cruel,  
x

x
wicked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bad-  
x

x
  
x

x
hearted. 
x

x
They  
x

x
make  
x

x
no  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
things,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
many  
x

x
clever  
x

x
ones. 
x

x
They  
x

x
can  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
mine  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
any  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
skilled  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
take  
x

x
the  
x

x
trouble,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
usually  
x

x
untidy  
x

x
and  
x

x
dirty. 
x

x
Hammers,  
x

x
  
x

x
axes,  
x

x
swords,  
x

x
daggers,  
x

x
pickaxes,  
x

x
tongs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
instruments  
x

x
of  
x

x
torture,  
x

x
they  
x

x
make  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
get  
x

x
other  
x

x
people  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
design,  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
and  
x

x
slaves  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
work  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
die  
x

x
for  
x

x
want  
x

x
of  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
light. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
unlikely  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
invented  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
machines  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
troubled  
x

x
the  
x

x
world,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ingenious  
x

x
devices  
x

x
for  
x

killing

large

numbers

of

people

x

x
once,

for

wheels  
x

and  
x

x
engines  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
explosions  
x

x
always  
x

x
delighted  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
working  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
hands  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
help;  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days  
x

x
and  
x

x
those  
x

x
wild  
x

x
  
x

x
parts  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
advanced  
x

x
(as  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
called)  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
far. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
hate  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
especially,  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
they  
x

x
hated  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
and  
x

x
everything,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
the  
x

x
orderly  
x

x
and  
x

x
prosperous;  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
parts  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
even  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
alliances  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
special  
x

x
  
x

x
grudge  
x

x
against  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
people,  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
war  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
mentioned,  
x

x
but  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
this  
x

x
tale;  
x

x
and  
x

x
anyway  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
don't  
x

x
care  
x

x
who  
x

x
they  
x

x
catch,  
x

x
as  
x

x
long  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
done  
x

x
smart  
x

x
and  
x

x
secret,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
defend  
x

x
themselves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
these  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
persons?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
this!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
drivers,  
x

x
  
x

x
pulling  
x

x
at  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
chain  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
forward  
x

x
  
x

x
onto  
x

x
his  
x

x
knees. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
found  
x

x
them  
x

x
sheltering  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Porch.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
mean  
x

x
by  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
turning  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Up  
x

x
to  
x

x
no  
x

x
good,  
x

x
I'll  
x

x
  
x

x
warrant!  
x

x
Spying  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
private  
x

x
business  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
people,  
x

x
I  
x

x
guess!  
x

x
Thieves,  
x

x
I  
x

x
shouldn’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
to  
x

x
learn!  
x

x
Murderers  
x

x
and  
x

x
friends  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Elves,  
x

x
not  
x

x
unlikely!  
x

x
Come!  
x

x
What  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
say?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thorin  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
replied  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
merely  
x

x
a  
x

x
polite  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
“Of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
things  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
suspect  
x

x
and  
x

x
imagine  
x

x
we  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
idea  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
We  
x

x
sheltered  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
storm  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
a  
x

x
convenient  
x

x
cave  
x

x
and  
x

x
unused;  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
was  
x

x
further  
x

x
from  
x

x
our  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
inconveniencing  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
in  
x

x
any  
x

x
way  
x

x
whatever.”  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
true  
x

x
enough!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Urn!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin. 
x

x
“So  
x

x
you  
x

x
say!  
x

x
  
x

x
Might  
x

x
I  
x

x
ask  
x

what

you

were

doing

up

in

the

mountains

at

x
all,

and  
x

where

you

were

coming

x
from,

and  
x

where

you

were

going

x
to?  
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

should  
x

x
like  
x

to

know

all

about

you. 
x

x
Not

that

it

will

do

x
you

much

good,

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield,  
x

x
I

know

too  
x

x
much  
x

x
about  
x

x
your

folk  
x

x
already;  
x

x
but  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth,  
x

x
or  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
prepare  
x

x
something  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable

x
for  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We

were

on

a

journey

to

our

the

East

side

of

these

truly  
x

hospitable  
x

mountains,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
what  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
all  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
moment,  
x

x
when  
x

x
obviously  
x

x
the  
x

x
exact  
x

x
truth  
x

x
would  
x

x

not

do

at

all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He

is  
x

x
a  
x

x
liar,  
x

x
O  
x

x
truly  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
one!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
drivers. 
x

x
“Several  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
people  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
struck  
x

x
by  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave,  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

invited

x

x
these

creatures

x
to  
x

come

below;

and

they

are  
x

as

x
  
x

x
dead  
x

x
as  
x

stones. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
not  
x

x
explained  
x

x
  
x

x
this!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
held  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
which  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
worn,  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
which  
x

came

from  
x

x
the  
x

Trolls'

lair. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
truly  
x

x
awful  
x

x
howl  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
rage  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
soldiers  
x

x
  
x

x
gnashed  
x

x
their  
x

x
teeth,  
x

x
clashed  
x

x
their  
x

x
shields,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
stamped. 
x

x
They  
x

x
knew  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
at  
x

x
once. 
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
killed  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
time,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fair  
x

x
elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gondolin  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
battle  
x

x
before  
x

x
their  
x

x
walls. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
called  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
Orcrist,  
x

x
Goblin-cleaver,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
called  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
simply  
x

x
Biter. 
x

x
They  
x

x
hated  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
hated  
x

x
worse  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
that  
x

x
carried  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Murderers  
x

x
and  
x

x
elf-friends!”  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
“Slash  
x

x
them!  
x

x
Beat  
x

x
them!  
x

x
Bite  
x

x
  
x

x
them!  
x

x
Gnash  
x

x
them!  
x

x
Take  
x

x
them  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
holes  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
snakes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
let  
x

x
them  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
rage  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
seat  
x

x
and  
x

x
himself  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
at  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
open. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
lights  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cavern  
x

x
went  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
fire  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
poof!  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
tower  
x

x
of  
x

x
blue  
x

x
glowing  
x

x
smoke,  
x

x
right  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof,  
x

x
that  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
piercing  
x

x
white  
x

x
  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
all  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
yells  
x

x
and  
x

x
yammering,  
x

x
croaking,  
x

x
  
x

x
jibbering  
x

x
and  
x

x
jabbering;  
x

x
howls,  
x

x
growls  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
curses;  
x

x
shrieking  
x

x
and  
x

x
skriking,  
x

x
that  
x

x
followed  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
description. 
x

x
Several  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
wild  
x

x
  
x

x
cats  
x

x
and  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
being  
x

x
roasted  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
alive  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
compared  
x

x
with  
x

x
it. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
were  
x

x
burning  
x

x
holes  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
that  
x

x
now  
x

x
fell  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
air  
x

x
too  
x

x
thick  
x

x
for  
x

x
even  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
through. 
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
falling  
x

x
over  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
in  
x

x
heaps  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
biting  
x

x
and  
x

x
kicking  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
gone  
x

x
mad. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
a  
x

x
sword  
x

x
flashed  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
own  
x

x
light. 
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
it  
x

x
go  
x

x
right  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
dumbfounded  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
rage. 
x

x
He  
x

x
fell  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
soldiers  
x

x
fled  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
shrieking  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sword  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
its  
x

x
sheath. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Follow  
x

x
me  
x

x
quick!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
quiet;  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
understood  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
happened  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
trotting  
x

x
along  
x

x
again,  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
trot,  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
line,  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
dark  
x

x
passages  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
yells  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-  
x

x
  
x

x
hall  
x

x
growing  
x

x
fainter  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him. 
x

x
A  
x

x
pale  
x

x
light  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
leading  
x

x
them  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Quicker,  
x

x
quicker!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
  
x

x
torches  
x

x
will  
x

x
soon  
x

x
be  
x

x
relit.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Half  
x

x
a  
x

x
minute!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
next  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
decent  
x

x
fellow. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
scramble  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
shoulders  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
best  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
tied  
x

x
hands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
run,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
clink-clink  
x

x
of  
x

x
chains,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
stumble,  
x

x
since  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
hands  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
steady  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
with. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
they  
x

x
stop,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
right  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
mountain’s  
x

x
heart. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
lit  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
wand. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gandalf;  
x

x
but  
x

x
just  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
busy  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
ask  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
there. 
x

x
He  
x

x
took  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
it  
x

x
flashed  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
by  
x

x
itself. 
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
burned  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
rage  
x

x
that  
x

x
made  
x

x
it  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
about;  
x

x
now  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
bright  
x

x
as  
x

x
blue  
x

x
  
x

x
flame  
x

x
for  
x

x
delight  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
killing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave. 
x

x
It  
x

x
made  
x

x
no  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
of  
x

x
cutting  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-chains  
x

x
and  
x

x
setting  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
free  
x

x
as  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
as  
x

x
possible. 
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
sword’s  
x

x
name  
x

x
was  
x

x
Glamdring  
x

x
the  
x

x
Foe-hammer,  
x

x
  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
remember. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
just  
x

x
called  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
Beater,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hated  
x

x
it  
x

x
worse  
x

x
than  
x

x
Biter  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
possible. 
x

x
Orcrist,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
saved;  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
it  
x

x
along  
x

x
as  
x

x
well,  
x

x
snatching  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
from  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
terrified  
x

x
guards. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
most  
x

x
things;  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
do  
x

x
everything,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
do  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
deal  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
friends  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
tight  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Are  
x

x
we  
x

x
all  
x

x
here?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he,  
x

x
handing  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
sword  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bow. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
me  
x

x
see:  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
—  
x

x
that's  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
two,  
x

x
three,  
x

x
four,  
x

x
five,  
x

x
six,  
x

x
  
x

x
seven,  
x

x
eight,  
x

x
nine,  
x

x
ten,  
x

x
eleven;  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili?  
x

x
Here  
x

x
they  
x

x
are!  
x

x
twelve,  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
here’s  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins:  
x

x
fourteen!  
x

x
Well,  
x

x
well!  
x

x
it  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
worse,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
again  
x

x
it  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
deal  
x

x
better. 
x

x
No  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
food,  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
quite  
x

x
where  
x

x
we  
x

x
are,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hordes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
angry  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
just  
x

x
behind!  
x

x
On  
x

x
we  
x

x
go!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
On  
x

x
they  
x

x
went. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
right:  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
noises  
x

x
and  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
cries  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
behind  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
passages  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
through. 
x

x
That  
x

x
sent  
x

x
them  
x

x
on  
x

x
faster  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
possibly  
x

x
go  
x

x
half  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
can  
x

x
roll  
x

x
along  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
  
x

x
pace,  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
—  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
turn  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
go  
x

x
faster  
x

x
than  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
knew  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
better  
x

x
(they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
paths  
x

x
themselves),  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
madly  
x

x
  
x

x
angry;  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
do  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
cries  
x

x
and  
x

x
howls  
x

x
getting  
x

x
closer  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
closer. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
flap  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
many  
x

x
many  
x

x
feet  
x

x
which  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
The  
x

x
blink  
x

x
of  
x

x
red  
x

x
  
x

x
torches  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
following;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
deadly  
x

x
tired. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why,  
x

x
O  
x

x
why  
x

x
did  
x

x
I  
x

x
ever  
x

x
leave  
x

x
my  
x

x
hobbit-  
x

x
  
x

x
hole!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
bumping  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bombur’s  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why,  
x

x
O  
x

x
why  
x

x
did  
x

x
I  
x

x
ever  
x

x
bring  
x

x
a  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
hunt!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
poor  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
fat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
staggered  
x

x
along  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sweat  
x

x
dripping  
x

x
down  
x

x
his  
x

x
nose  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
heat  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
terror. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
this  
x

x
point  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
fell  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
They  
x

x
turned  
x

x
a  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
“About  
x

x
  
x

x
turn!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
“Draw  
x

x
your  
x

x
sword  
x

x
Thorin!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
else  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
it. 
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
scurrying  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
corner  
x

x
in  
x

x
full  
x

x
cry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
Goblin-  
x

x
  
x

x
cleaver,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Foe-hammer  
x

x
shining  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bright  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
astonished  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
The  
x

x
ones  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
front  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
their  
x

x
torches  
x

x
and  
x

x
gave  
x

x
one  
x

x
yell  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
killed. 
x

x
The  
x

x
ones  
x

x
behind  
x

x
yelled  
x

x
  
x

x
still  
x

x
more,  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
back  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
over  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
running  
x

x
after  
x

x
them. 
x

x
“Biter  
x

x
and  
x

x
Beater!”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
shrieked;  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
confusion,  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
hustling  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
before  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn  
x

x
that  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
By  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
on  
x

x
again,  
x

x
a  
x

x
long,  
x

x
long,  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins’  
x

x
realm. 
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
that,  
x

x
they  
x

x
put  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
torches  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
soft  
x

x
shoes,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
chose  
x

x
out  
x

x
their  
x

x
very  
x

x
quickest  
x

x
runners  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
sharpest  
x

x
ears  
x

x
and  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
These  
x

x
ran  
x

x
  
x

x
forward,  
x

x
as  
x

x
swift  
x

x
as  
x

x
weasels  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x
noise  
x

x
than  
x

x
bats. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why  
x

x
neither  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
  
x

x
nor  
x

x
even  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
heard  
x

x
them  
x

x
coming. 
x

x
Nor  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
see  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
seen  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
that  
x

x
ran  
x

x
silently  
x

x
up  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
letting  
x

x
his  
x

x
wand  
x

x
give  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
faint  
x

x
light  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
along. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Quite  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
now  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
was  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
He  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
shoulders  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
blackness,  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
on  
x

x
hard  
x

x
rock,  
x

x
and  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
more.

x
  
x

x
RIDDLES  
x

x
IN  
x

x
THE  
x

x
DARK  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
opened  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
he  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had;  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
dark  
x

x
as  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
shut. 
x

x
  
x

x
No  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
near  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
imagine  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
fright!  
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
see  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
except  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Very  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
groped  
x

x
about  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
fours,  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
touched  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
neither  
x

x
up  
x

x
nor  
x

x
down  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
he  
x

x
find  
x

x
anything:  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
His  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
swimming,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
certain  
x

x
even  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
going  
x

x
in  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
his  
x

x
fall. 
x

x
He  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could,  
x

x
and  
x

x
crawled  
x

x
along  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
way,  
x

x
till  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
met  
x

x
what  
x

x
felt  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
cold  
x

x
metal  
x

x
lying  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
turning  
x

x
point  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
career,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
put  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
pocket  
x

x
almost  
x

x
without  
x

x
thinking;  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
it  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
seem  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
particular  
x

x
use  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
much  
x

x
further,  
x

x
but  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cold  
x

x
floor  
x

x
and  
x

x
gave  
x

x
himself  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
complete  
x

x
  
x

x
miserableness,  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
frying  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
and  
x

x
eggs  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
kitchen  
x

x
at  
x

x
home  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
inside  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
high  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
meal  
x

x
or  
x

x
other;  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
miserabler. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
think  
x

x
what  
x

x
to  
x

x
do;  
x

x
nor  
x

x
could  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened;  
x

x
or  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
behind;  
x

x
or  
x

x
why,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
left  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
caught  
x

x
him;  
x

x
or  
x

x
even  
x

x
why  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
sore. 
x

x
The  
x

x
truth  
x

x
was  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
lying  
x

x
quiet,  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
sight  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
corner  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
pipe. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
broken,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
something. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
pouch,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
some  
x

x
tobacco  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
something  
x

x
more. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
matches  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
find  
x

x
any  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
shattered  
x

x
his  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
completely. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
for  
x

x
him,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
agreed  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
senses. 
x

x
Goodness  
x

x
knows  
x

x
what  
x

x
the  
x

x
striking  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
matches  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
smell  
x

x
of  
x

x
tobacco  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
on  
x

x
him  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
dark  
x

x
holes  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
  
x

x
place. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
very  
x

x
crushed. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
slapping  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
pockets  
x

x
and  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
himself  
x

x
for  
x

x
matches  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hilt  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
dagger  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten;  
x

x
nor  
x

x
fortunately  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
it,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
wore  
x

x
it  
x

x
inside  
x

x
his  
x

x
breeches. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
he  
x

x
drew  
x

x
it  
x

x
out. 
x

x
It  
x

x
shone  
x

x
pale  
x

x
and  
x

x
dim  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
“So  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
an  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
blade,  
x

x
too,”  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought;  
x

x
“and  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
near,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
yet  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
enough.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
somehow  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
comforted. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
splendid  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
wearing  
x

x
a  
x

x
blade  
x

x
made  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
Gondolin  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-wars  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
so  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
songs  
x

x
had  
x

x
sung;  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
weapons  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
impression  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them  
x

x
suddenly. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Go  
x

x
back?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
“No  
x

x
good  
x

x
at  
x

x
all!  
x

x
Go  
x

x
  
x

x
sideways?  
x

x
Impossible!  
x

x
Go  
x

x
forward?  
x

x
Only  
x

x
thing  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
do!  
x

x
On  
x

x
we  
x

x
go!”  
x

x
So  
x

x
up  
x

x
he  
x

x
got,  
x

x
and  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword  
x

x
held  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
one  
x

x
hand  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
patter  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
pitter. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
called  
x

x
a  
x

x
tight  
x

x
  
x

x
place. 
x

x
But  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
remember  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
tight  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
for  
x

x
me  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
you. 
x

x
Hobbits  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
like  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
  
x

x
people;  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
if  
x

x
their  
x

x
holes  
x

x
are  
x

x
nice  
x

x
  
x

x
cheery  
x

x
places  
x

x
and  
x

x
properly  
x

x
aired,  
x

x
quite  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
still  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
tunnelling  
x

x
than  
x

x
we  
x

x
are,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
easily  
x

x
lose  
x

x
their  
x

x
sense  
x

x
of  
x

x
direction  
x

x
  
x

x
underground  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
when  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
recovered  
x

x
from  
x

x
being  
x

x
bumped. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
move  
x

x
very  
x

x
quietly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hide  
x

x
easily,  
x

x
and  
x

x
recover  
x

x
  
x

x
wonderfully  
x

x
from  
x

x
falls  
x

x
and  
x

x
bruises,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
fund  
x

x
of  
x

x
wisdom  
x

x
and  
x

x
wise  
x

x
sayings  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
have  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
or  
x

x
have  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
in  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
place,  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same. 
x

x
The  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
end. 
x

x
All  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
going  
x

x
down  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
and  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
direction  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
twist  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
turn  
x

x
or  
x

x
two. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
passages  
x

x
leading  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
then,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
glimmer  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
or  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
these  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
no  
x

x
notice,  
x

x
except  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
hurry  
x

x
past  
x

x
for  
x

x
fear  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
or  
x

x
half-imagined  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
things  
x

x
coming  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
them. 
x

x
On  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
went,  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
down;  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
anything  
x

x
except  
x

x
the  
x

x
occasional  
x

x
whirr  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bat  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
which  
x

x
startled  
x

x
him  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
till  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
became  
x

x
too  
x

x
frequent  
x

x
to  
x

x
bother  
x

x
about. 
x

x
I  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
how  
x

x
long  
x

x
he  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
like  
x

x
this,  
x

x
hating  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
on,  
x

x
not  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
stop,  
x

x
on,  
x

x
on,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
tireder  
x

x
than  
x

x
tired. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
like  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
tomorrow  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
beyond. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
without  
x

x
any  
x

x
warning  
x

x
he  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
splash  
x

x
into  
x

x
water!  
x

x
Ugh!  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
icy  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
That  
x

x
  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
and  
x

x
short. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
a  
x

x
pool  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
path,  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
underground  
x

x
stream  
x

x
that  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage,  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
brink  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
subterranean  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sword  
x

x
was  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
shining  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
He  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
listened  
x

x
hard,  
x

x
drops  
x

x
drip-drip-dripping  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
an  
x

x
unseen  
x

x
roof  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
below;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
no  
x

x
other  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
sound. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“So  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
pool  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
lake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
underground  
x

x
river,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
wade  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
swim;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
of  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
  
x

x
things,  
x

x
with  
x

x
big  
x

x
bulging  
x

x
blind  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
wriggling  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
water. 
x

x
There  
x

x
are  
x

x
strange  
x

x
things  
x

x
living  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
pools  
x

x
and  
x

x
lakes  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
of  
x

x
mountains:  
x

x
fish  
x

x
  
x

x
whose  
x

x
fathers  
x

x
swam  
x

x
in,  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
only  
x

x
knows  
x

x
  
x

x
how  
x

x
many  
x

x
years  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
swam  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
while  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
grew  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
and  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
from  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
blackness;  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
other  
x

x
things  
x

x
more  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
than  
x

x
fish. 
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
and  
x

x
caves  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
other  
x

x
things  
x

x
  
x

x
living  
x

x
unbeknown  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
sneaked  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
outside  
x

x
to  
x

x
lie  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
caves,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
beginnings  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
ages  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
who  
x

x
only  
x

x
widened  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
joined  
x

x
them  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
passages,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
original  
x

x
owners  
x

x
are  
x

x
still  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
odd  
x

x
  
x

x
corners,  
x

x
slinking  
x

x
and  
x

x
nosing  
x

x
about. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Deep  
x

x
down  
x

x
here  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
water  
x

x
lived  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
creature. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
from,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
who  
x

x
or  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
was. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
—  
x

x
as  
x

x
dark  
x

x
as  
x

x
darkness,  
x

x
except  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
two  
x

x
big  
x

x
round  
x

x
pale  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
thin  
x

x
face. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
boat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
rowed  
x

x
about  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake;  
x

x
for  
x

x
lake  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,  
x

x
wide  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
deadly  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
He  
x

x
paddled  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
large  
x

x
  
x

x
feet  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
side,  
x

x
but  
x

x
never  
x

x
a  
x

x
ripple  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
he  
x

x
make. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
he. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
looking  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
pale  
x

x
lamp-like  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
for  
x

x
blind  
x

x
fish,  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
long  
x

x
fingers  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
thinking. 
x

x
He  
x

x
liked  
x

x
meat  
x

x
too. 
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
  
x

x
good,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
it;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
care  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
never  
x

x
found  
x

x
him  
x

x
out. 
x

x
He  
x

x
just  
x

x
throttled  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
ever  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
alone  
x

x
  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
prowling  
x

x
about. 
x

x
They  
x

x
very  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
did,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
something  
x

x
unpleasant  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
lurking  
x

x
down  
x

x
there,  
x

x
down  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
roots  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
tunnelling  
x

x
down  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
go  
x

x
no  
x

x
further;  
x

x
so  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
road  
x

x
ended  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
direction,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
reason  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
—  
x

x
unless  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
sent  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Sometimes  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
fancy  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
fish  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
neither  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
nor  
x

x
fish  
x

x
came  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Actually  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
lived  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
island  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
rock  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
watching  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
now  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
pale  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
telescopes. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
him,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
about  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
got  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat  
x

x
and  
x

x
shot  
x

x
off  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
island,  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
brink  
x

x
  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
flummoxed  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
up  
x

x
came  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
and  
x

x
hissed:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bless  
x

x
us  
x

x
and  
x

x
splash  
x

x
us,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precioussss!  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
guess  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
a  
x

x
choice  
x

x
feast;  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
a  
x

x
tasty  
x

x
morsel  
x

x
  
x

x
it’d  
x

x
make  
x

x
us,  
x

x
gollum!”And  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
swallowing  
x

x
noise  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
throat. 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
his  
x

x
name,  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
called  
x

x
himself  
x

x
‘my  
x

x
precious’. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
skin  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
hiss  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
pale  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
out  
x

x
at  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
thrusting  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
dagger  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
iss  
x

x
he,  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciouss?”  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
(who  
x

x
always  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
having  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
else  
x

x
to  
x

x
speak  
x

x
to). 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
out,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
very  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment,  
x

x
only  
x

x
curious;  
x

x
  
x

x
otherwise  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
first  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
afterwards. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
lost  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
lost  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
where  
x

x
I  
x

x
am;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
know,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
get  
x

x
away.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What’s  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
handses?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
like. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
a  
x

x
blade  
x

x
which  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Gondolin!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Sssss”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
and  
x

x
became  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
polite. 
x

x
“Praps  
x

x
ye  
x

x
sits  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
chats

It

x

x
it  
x

x

does,

x
does  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
anxious  
x

x
to  
x

x
appear  
x

x
  
x

x
friendly,  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment,  
x

x
and  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
alone  
x

x
really,  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
good  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
  
x

x
hungry. 
x

x
Riddles  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
think  
x

x
of. 
x

x
  
x

x
Asking  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
guessing  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
game  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
ever  
x

x
played  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
other  
x

x
funny  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
holes  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
long,  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
lost  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
driven  
x

x
away,  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
crept  
x

x
down,  
x

x
  
x

x
down,  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
anxious  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
agree,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
creature,  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
whether  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
or  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
friend  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
ask  
x

x
first,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
because  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
riddle. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
hissed:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
What  
x

x
has  
x

x
roots  
x

x
as  
x

x
nobody  
x

x
sees,  
x

x
  
x

x
Is  
x

x
taller  
x

x
than  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Up,  
x

x
up  
x

x
it  
x

x
goes,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
yet  
x

x
never  
x

x
grows?  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Easy!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Mountain,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Does  
x

x
it  
x

x
guess  
x

x
easy?  
x

x
It  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
competition  
x

x
with  
x

x
us,  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciouss!  
x

x
If  
x

x
precious  
x

x
  
x

x
asks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
doesn’t  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
we  
x

x
eats  
x

x
it,  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
preciousss. 
x

x
If  
x

x
it  
x

x
asks  
x

x
us,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
doesn’t  
x

x
  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
then  
x

x
we  
x

x
does  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
wants,  
x

x
eh?  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
shows  
x

x
it  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out,  
x

x
yes!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“All  
x

x
right!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
not  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
disagree,  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
bursting  
x

x
his  
x

x
brain  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
riddles  
x

x
that  
x

x
could  
x

x
save  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
being  
x

x
eaten. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thirty  
x

x
white  
x

x
horses  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
hill,  
x

x
  
x

x
First  
x

x
they  
x

x
champ,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
stamp,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
stand  
x

x
still. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
eating  
x

x
was  
x

x
rather  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
one,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
knew  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
answer  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
do. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Chestnuts,  
x

x
chestnuts,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
hissed. 
x

x
“Teeth!  
x

x
  
x

x
teeth!  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciousss;  
x

x
but  
x

x
we  
x

x
has  
x

x
only  
x

x
six!”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked  
x

x
his  
x

x
second:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Voiceless  
x

x
it  
x

x
cries,  
x

x
  
x

x
Wingless  
x

x
flutters,  
x

x
  
x

x
Toothless  
x

x
bites,  
x

x
  
x

x
Mouthless  
x

x
mutters. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Half  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
uncomfortably  
x

x
about  
x

x
eating. 
x

x
Fortunately  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
once  
x

x
heard  
x

x
something  
x

x
rather  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
before,  
x

x
and  
x

x
getting  
x

x
his  
x

x
wits  
x

x
back  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
“Wind,  
x

x
wind  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
one  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spot. 
x

x
“This’ll  
x

x
puzzle  
x

x
the  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
underground  
x

x
creature,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
An  
x

x
eye  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
blue  
x

x
face  
x

x
  
x

x
Sawan  
x

x
eye  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
green  
x

x
face. 
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
eye  
x

x
is  
x

x
like  
x

x
to  
x

x
this  
x

x
eye”  
x

x
  
x

x
Said  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
eye,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Butin  
x

x
tow  
x

x
place  
x

x
  
x

x
Notin  
x

x
high  
x

x
place.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ss,  
x

x
ss,  
x

x
ss,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
underground  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
long  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
forgetting  
x

x
this  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
thing. 
x

x
But  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
hope  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
wretch  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
brought  
x

x
up  
x

x
memories  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
ages  
x

x
and  
x

x
ages  
x

x
and  
x

x
ages  
x

x
before,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
lived  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
grandmother  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hole  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
bank  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
river,  
x

x
“Sss,  
x

x
sss,  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciouss,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Sun  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
daisies  
x

x
it  
x

x
means,  
x

x
it  
x

x
does.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
these  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
above  
x

x
ground  
x

x
everyday  
x

x
  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
riddles  
x

x
were  
x

x
tiring  
x

x
for  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
reminded  
x

x
him  
x

x
of  
x

x
days  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
less  
x

x
  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
and  
x

x
sneaky  
x

x
and  
x

x
nasty,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
put  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
temper. 
x

x
What  
x

x
is  
x

x
more  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
hungry;  
x

x
so  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
tried  
x

x
something  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
unpleasant:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen,  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
felt,  
x

x
  
x

x
Cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
heard,  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
smelt. 
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
lies  
x

x
behind  
x

x
stars  
x

x
and  
x

x
Underhills,  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
empty  
x

x
holes  
x

x
it  
x

x
fills. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
comes  
x

x
first  
x

x
and  
x

x
follows  
x

x
after,  
x

x
  
x

x
Ends  
x

x
life,  
x

x
kills  
x

x
laughter. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Unfortunately  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
thing  
x

x
before;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
anyway. 
x

x
“Dark!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
without  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
scratching  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
or  
x

x
putting  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
  
x

x
cap. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
box  
x

x
without  
x

x
hinges,  
x

x
key,  
x

x
or  
x

x
lid,  
x

x
  
x

x
Yet  
x

x
golden  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
inside  
x

x
is  
x

x
hid,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked  
x

x
to  
x

x
gain  
x

x
time,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
hard  
x

x
one. 
x

x
This  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
a  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
  
x

x
easy  
x

x
chestnut,  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
asked  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
usual  
x

x
words. 
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
proved  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
poser  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
He  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
answer;  
x

x
he  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
and  
x

x
spluttered. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
some  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
became  
x

x
impatient. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
answer’s  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
kettle  
x

x
boiling  
x

x
over,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
making.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Give  
x

x
us  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance;  
x

x
let  
x

x
it  
x

x
give  
x

x
us  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance,  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciouss  
x

x
—  
x

x
ss  
x

x
—  
x

x
ss.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
after  
x

x
giving  
x

x
him  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
chance,  
x

x
“what  
x

x
about  
x

x
your  
x

x
guess?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
thieving  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
nests  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
bank  
x

x
teaching  
x

x
his  
x

x
grandmother,  
x

x
teaching  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
grandmother  
x

x
to  
x

x
suck  
x

x
—  
x

x
“Eggses!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
hissed. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Eggses  
x

x
it  
x

x
is!”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Alive  
x

x
without  
x

x
breath,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
cold  
x

x
as  
x

x
death;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Never  
x

x
thirsty,  
x

x
ever  
x

x
drinking,  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
in  
x

x
mail  
x

x
never  
x

x
clinking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
also  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
turn  
x

x
thought  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
easy  
x

x
one,  
x

x
because  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
anything  
x

x
better  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
flustered  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
egg-question. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
poser  
x

x
for  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
anything  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
help  
x

x
it. 
x

x
I  
x

x
imagine  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course,  
x

x
or  
x

x
can  
x

x
guess  
x

x
it  
x

x
as  
x

x
easy  
x

x
as  
x

x
winking,  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
comfortably  
x

x
at  
x

x
home  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
danger  
x

x
of  
x

x
being  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
to  
x

x
disturb  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
thinking. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

x
and  
x

x
cleared  
x

x
his  
x

x
throat  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
or  
x

x
twice,  
x

x
but  
x

x
no  
x

x
answer  
x

x
came. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
hiss  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
pleasure  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself:  
x

x
“Is  
x

x
it  
x

x
nice,  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciousss?  
x

x
  
x

x
Is  
x

x
it  
x

x
juicy?  
x

x
Is  
x

x
it  
x

x
scrumptiously  
x

x
crunchable?”  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
peer  
x

x
at  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Half  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
shivering. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
gave  
x

x
you  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
long  
x

x
chance  
x

x
just  
x

x
now.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
must  
x

x
make  
x

x
haste,  
x

x
haste!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
climb  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
at  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
But  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
webby  
x

x
foot  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
a  
x

x
fish  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fright  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
toes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ugh!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“it  
x

x
is  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
clammy!”  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed. 
x

x
“Fish!  
x

x
fish!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
fish!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
disappointed;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
asked  
x

x
another  
x

x
riddle  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
boat  
x

x
and  
x

x
think. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
No-legs  
x

x
lay  
x

x
on  
x

x
one-leg,  
x

x
two-legs  
x

x
sat  
x

x
near  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
three-legs,  
x

x
four-legs  
x

x
got  
x

x
some. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
really  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
this  
x

x
riddle,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hurry. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
guessing  
x

x
it,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
asked  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
time. 
x

x
As  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,  
x

x
talking  
x

x
offish,  
x

x
“no-legs”  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
very  
x

x
difficult,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
easy.

x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
soon  
x

x
gave  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
hard  
x

x
and  
x

x
horrible. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
thing  
x

x
all  
x

x
things  
x

x
devours:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Birds,  
x

x
beasts,  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
flowers;  
x

x
  
x

x
Gnaws  
x

x
iron,  
x

x
bites  
x

x
steel;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Grinds  
x

x
hard  
x

x
stones  
x

x
to

x

x
Slays  
x

x
king,  
x

x
ruins  
x

x
town,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
beats  
x

x
high  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
names  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
giants  
x

x
and  
x

x
ogres  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
ever  
x

x
heard  
x

x
told  
x

x
of  
x

x
in  
x

x
tales,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
done  
x

x
all  
x

x
these  
x

x
things. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
different  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
it,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
frightened,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
bad  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
thinking. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
flapped  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
and  
x

x
paddled  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bank;  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
coming  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
His  
x

x
tongue  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
stick  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth;  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
shout  
x

x
out:  
x

x
“Give  
x

x
me  
x

x
more  
x

x
time!  
x

x
  
x

x
Give  
x

x
me  
x

x
time!”  
x

x
But  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
squeal  
x

x
was:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Time!  
x

x
Time!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
saved  
x

x
by  
x

x
pure  
x

x
luck. 
x

x
For  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
disappointed  
x

x
once  
x

x
more;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
angry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
tired  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
game. 
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
made  
x

x
him  
x

x
very  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
indeed. 
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
boat. 
x

x
He  
x

x
sat  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
by  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
That  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
and  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It’s  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
uss  
x

x
a  
x

x

x

x

x

x

x

x

x
yess,  
x

x
yesss. 
x

x
Jusst  
x

x
one  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
question  
x

x
to  
x

x
guess,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
yess,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
simply  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
question  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
wet  
x

x
cold  
x

x
thing  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
  
x

x
next  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
pawing  
x

x
and  
x

x
poking  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
scratched  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
he  
x

x
pinched  
x

x
himself;  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
anything. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ask  
x

x
us!  
x

x
ask  
x

x
us!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
pinched  
x

x
himself  
x

x
and  
x

x
slapped  
x

x
himself;  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
gripped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword;  
x

x
he  
x

x
even  
x

x
felt  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
pocket  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
other  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ring  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
picked  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
about. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
have  
x

x
I  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
pocket?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
talking  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
riddle,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
frightfully  
x

x
  
x

x
upset. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
fair!  
x

x
not  
x

x
fair!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
hissed. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
isn’t  
x

x
fair,  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
is  
x

x
it,  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
us  
x

x
what  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
got  
x

x

x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
nassty  
x

x
little  
x

x
pocketses?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
seeing  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
having  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
better  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
question,  
x

x
“What  
x

x
have  
x

x
I  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
pocket?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
louder. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“S-s-s-s-s,”  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
must  
x

x
give  
x

x
us  
x

x
  
x

x
three  
x

x
guesseses,  
x

x
my  
x

x
preciouss,  
x

x
three  
x

x
  
x

x
guesseses.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well!  
x

x
Guess  
x

x
away!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Handses!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Wrong,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
luckily  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
taken  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
out  
x

x
again. 
x

x
“Guess  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“S-s-s-s-s,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
more  
x

x
upset  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
things  
x

x
he  
x

x
kept  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
pockets:  
x

x
fish-bones,  
x

x
goblins’  
x

x
teeth,  
x

x
wet  
x

x
  
x

x
shells,  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
bat-wing,  
x

x
a  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
stone  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sharpen  
x

x
his  
x

x
fangs  
x

x
on,  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
things. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
what  
x

x
other  
x

x
people  
x

x
kept  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
pockets. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Knife!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
at  
x

x
last. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Wrong!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
his  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
“Last  
x

x
guess!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
much  
x

x
worse  
x

x
state  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
asked  
x

x
him  
x

x
the  
x

x
egg-  
x

x
  
x

x
question. 
x

x
He  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
and  
x

x
spluttered  
x

x
and  
x

x
rocked  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
backwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
forwards,  
x

x
and  
x

x
slapped  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wriggled  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
squirmed;  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
waste  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
guess. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
on!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
waiting!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
sound  
x

x
bold  
x

x
and  
x

x
cheerful,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
feel  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
sure  
x

x
how  
x

x
the  
x

x
game  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
end,  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
right  
x

x
or  
x

x
not. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Time’s  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“String,  
x

x
or  
x

x
nothing!”  
x

x
shrieked  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
fair  
x

x
—  
x

x
working  
x

x
in  
x

x
two  
x

x
guesses  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
once. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Both  
x

x
wrong,”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
very  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
relieved;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
held  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword. 
x

x
He  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
riddle-  
x

x
  
x

x
game  
x

x
was  
x

x
sacred  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
immense  
x

x
antiquity,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
were  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
to  
x

x
cheat  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
played  
x

x
at  
x

x
it. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
trust  
x

x
this  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
any  
x

x
promise  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
pinch. 
x

x
Any  
x

x
excuse  
x

x
would  
x

x
do  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
slide  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
And  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
last  
x

x
question  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
genuine  
x

x
riddle  
x

x
according  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
  
x

x
laws. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
attack  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
He  
x

x
sat  
x

x
still,  
x

x
shivering  
x

x
and  
x

x
whispering. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
wait  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
your  
x

x
promise?  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
go. 
x

x
You  
x

x
must  
x

x
show  
x

x
me  
x

x
the  
x

x
way.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Did  
x

x
we  
x

x
say  
x

x
so,  
x

x
precious?  
x

x
Show  
x

x
the  
x

x
nassty  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
But  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
it  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
pocketses,  
x

x
eh?  
x

x
Not  
x

x
string,  
x

x
  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
Oh  
x

x
no!  
x

x
gollum!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Never  
x

x
you  
x

x
mind,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“A  
x

x
promise  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
promise.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Cross  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,  
x

x
impatient,  
x

x
precious,”  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
it  
x

x
must  
x

x
wait,  
x

x
yes  
x

x
it  
x

x
must. 
x

x
We  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
so  
x

x
hasty. 
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
things  
x

x
first,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
things  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
us.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
hurry  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
relieved  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
going  
x

x
away. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
making  
x

x
an  
x

x
excuse  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
mean  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
back. 
x

x
What  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
talking  
x

x
about?  
x

x
What  
x

x
  
x

x
useful  
x

x
thing  
x

x
could  
x

x
he  
x

x
keep  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
lake?  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
wrong. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
did  
x

x
mean  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
back. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
angry  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
hungry. 
x

x
And  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
creature,  
x

x
and  
x

x
already  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
plan. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
island,  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hiding-place  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
oddments,  
x

x
and  
x

x
one  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
very  
x

x
beautiful,  
x

x
very  
x

x
wonderful. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
a  
x

x
golden  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
a  
x

x
precious  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My  
x

x
birthday-present!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
often  
x

x
done  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
endless  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
days. 
x

x
“That’s  
x

x
what  
x

x
we  
x

x
wants  
x

x
now,  
x

x
yes;  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
wants  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
it  
x

x
because  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
power,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
that  
x

x
ring  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
finger,  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
invisible;  
x

x
only  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
full  
x

x
sunlight  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
you  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
only  
x

x
by  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
shadow,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
shaky  
x

x
and  
x

x
faint. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My  
x

x
birthday-present!  
x

x
It  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
me  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
birthday,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precious.”  
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
always  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
But  
x

x
who  
x

x
knows  
x

x
how  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
came  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
present,  
x

x
ages  
x

x
ago  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
days  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
rings  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
at  
x

x
large  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
world?  
x

x
  
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
who  
x

x
ruled  
x

x
them  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
said. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
wear  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
till  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
tired  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
kept  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pouch  
x

x
next  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
skin,  
x

x
till  
x

x
it  
x

x
galled  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
usually  
x

x
he  
x

x
hid  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hole  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
island,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
going  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
at  
x

x
it. 
x

x
And  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
it  
x

x
on,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
bear  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
parted  
x

x
from  
x

x
it  
x

x
any  
x

x
longer,  
x

x
or  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
very,  
x

x
very,  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
tired  
x

x
of  
x

x
fish. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
creep  
x

x
along  
x

x
dark  
x

x
passages  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
stray  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
He  
x

x
might  
x

x
even  
x

x
venture  
x

x
into  
x

x
places  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
torches  
x

x
were  
x

x
lit  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
blink  
x

x
and  
x

x
smart;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
safe. 
x

x
Oh  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
safe. 
x

x
No  
x

x
one  
x

x
would  
x

x
see  
x

x
him,  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
notice  
x

x
him,  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
his  
x

x
fingers  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
throat. 
x

x
  
x

x
Only  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
hours  
x

x
ago  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
worn  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
caught  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
goblin-imp. 
x

x
How  
x

x
it  
x

x
squeaked!  
x

x
He  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
bone  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
left  
x

x
to  
x

x
gnaw,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
softer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Quite  
x

x
safe,  
x

x
yes,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
see  
x

x
us,  
x

x
will  
x

x
it,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precious?  
x

x
No. 
x

x
It  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
us,  
x

x
and  
x

x
its  
x

x
nassty  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
useless,  
x

x
yes  
x

x
quite.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
little  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
from  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
side,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
flapped  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
he  
x

x
waited  
x

x
a  
x

x
while;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
idea  
x

x
how  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
alone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
a  
x

x
screech. 
x

x
It  
x

x
sent  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
shiver  
x

x
down  
x

x
his  
x

x
back. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wailing  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom,  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
island,  
x

x
scrabbling  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there,  
x

x
searching  
x

x
and  
x

x
seeking  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
iss  
x

x
it?  
x

x
Where  
x

x
iss  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
crying. 
x

x
“Losst  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
lost!  
x

x
  
x

x
Curse  
x

x
us  
x

x
and  
x

x
crush  
x

x
us,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precious  
x

x
is  
x

x
lost!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
matter?”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
called. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
lost?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
mustn’t  
x

x
ask  
x

x
us,”  
x

x
shrieked  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
"Not  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
business,  
x

x
no,  
x

x
gollum!  
x

x
It’s  
x

x
losst,  
x

x
gollum,  
x

x
gollum,  
x

x
  
x

x
gollum.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
so  
x

x
am  
x

x
I,”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
unlost. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
won  
x

x
the  
x

x
game,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
promised. 
x

x
So  
x

x
come  
x

x
along!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
your  
x

x
looking!”  
x

x
Utterly  
x

x
  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
as  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
sounded,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
find  
x

x
much  
x

x
pity  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
anything  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
be  
x

x
something  
x

x
good. 
x

x
“Come  
x

x
along!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No,  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
precious!”  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
answered. 
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
must  
x

x
search  
x

x
for  
x

x
it,  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
gollum.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
you  
x

x
never  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
my  
x

x
last  
x

x
question,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
promised,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Never  
x

x
guessed!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
hiss. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
has  
x

x
it  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
pocketses?  
x

x
Tell  
x

x
us  
x

x
that. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
tell  
x

x
first.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
particular  
x

x
reason  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
should  
x

x
not  
x

x
tell. 
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
mind  
x

x
had  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
guess  
x

x
quicker  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
his;  
x

x
naturally,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
had  
x

x
brooded  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
ages  
x

x
on  
x

x
this  
x

x
one  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
of  
x

x
its  
x

x
being  
x

x
stolen. 
x

x
But  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
annoyed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
delay. 
x

x
After  
x

x
all,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
won  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
game,  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
fairly,  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
risk. 
x

x
“Answers  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
not  
x

x
given,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
it  
x

x
wasn’t  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
question,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Not  
x

x
a  
x

x
riddle,  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
no.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Oh  
x

x
well,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
  
x

x
questions,”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
replied,  
x

x
“then  
x

x
I  
x

x
asked  
x

x
one  
x

x
first. 
x

x
  
x

x
What  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
lost?  
x

x
Tell  
x

x
me  
x

x
that!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
has  
x

x
it  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
pocketses?”  
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
came  
x

x
hissing  
x

x
louder  
x

x
and  
x

x
sharper,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
towards  
x

x
it,  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
alarm  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
two  
x

x
small  
x

x
points  
x

x
of  
x

x
light  
x

x
peering  
x

x
at  
x

x
him. 
x

x
As  
x

x
  
x

x
suspicion  
x

x
grew  
x

x
in  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
burned  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
pale  
x

x
flame. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
lost?”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
persisted. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
in  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
become  
x

x
a  
x

x
green  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
coming  
x

x
swiftly  
x

x
  
x

x
nearer. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat  
x

x
again,  
x

x
paddling  
x

x
  
x

x
wildly  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
shore;  
x

x
and  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
rage  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
loss  
x

x
and  
x

x
suspicion  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
that  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
sword  
x

x
had  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x
terror  
x

x
for  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
guess  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
maddened  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
creature,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
all  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
murder  
x

x
him  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
rate. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
blindly  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
passage  
x

x
down  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
come,  
x

x
  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
has  
x

x
it  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
pocketses?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hiss  
x

x
loud  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
splash  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
boat. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
have  
x

x
I,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
wonder?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
panted  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
along. 
x

x
He  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
left  
x

x
hand  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
pocket. 
x

x
The  
x

x
ring  
x

x
felt  
x

x
very  
x

x
cold  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
groping  
x

x
forefinger. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
hiss  
x

x
was  
x

x
close  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
turned  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
saw  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
like  
x

x
small  
x

x
green  
x

x
  
x

x
lamps  
x

x
coming  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
slope. 
x

x
Terrified  
x

x
he  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
run  
x

x
faster,  
x

x
but  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
struck  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
snag  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
flat  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
him. 
x

x
But  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
do  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
recover  
x

x
his  
x

x
breath,  
x

x
  
x

x
pick  
x

x
himself  
x

x
up,  
x

x
or  
x

x
wave  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
passed  
x

x
by,  
x

x
taking  
x

x
no  
x

x
notice  
x

x
of  
x

x
him,  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
whispering  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
ran. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
What  
x

x
could  
x

x
it  
x

x
mean?  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
palely  
x

x
shining  
x

x
even  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
Painfully  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sheathed  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
glowing  
x

x
faintly  
x

x
again,  
x

x
then  
x

x
very  
x

x
cautiously  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
followed. 
x

x
There  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
else  
x

x
to  
x

x
do. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
back  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
  
x

x
water. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
followed  
x

x
him,  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
lead  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
some  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
escape  
x

x
without  
x

x
  
x

x
meaning  
x

x
to. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Curse  
x

x
it!  
x

x
curse  
x

x
it!  
x

x
curse  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Curse  
x

x
the  
x

x
Baggins!  
x

x
It’s  
x

x
gone!  
x

x
What  
x

x
has  
x

x
it  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
pocketses?  
x

x
Oh  
x

x
we  
x

x
guess,  
x

x
we  
x

x
guess,  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
precious. 
x

x
He’s  
x

x
found  
x

x
it,  
x

x
yes  
x

x
he  
x

x
must  
x

x
have. 
x

x
My  
x

x
  
x

x
birthday-present.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
pricked  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
guess  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
a  
x

x
little,  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
as  
x

x
close  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
dared  
x

x
behind  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
going  
x

x
quickly,  
x

x
not  
x

x
looking  
x

x
back,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
turning  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
from  
x

x
side  
x

x
to  
x

x
side,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
faint  
x

x
glimmer  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My  
x

x
birthday-present!  
x

x
Curse  
x

x
it!  
x

x
How  
x

x
did  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
lose  
x

x
it,  
x

x
my  
x

x
precious?  
x

x
Yes,  
x

x
that’s  
x

x
it. 
x

x
When  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
last,  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
that  
x

x
nassty  
x

x
  
x

x
young  
x

x
squeaker. 
x

x
That’s  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Curse  
x

x
it!  
x

x
It  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
us,  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
these  
x

x
ages  
x

x
and  
x

x
ages!  
x

x
It’s  
x

x
  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
gollum."  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
weep,  
x

x
a  
x

x
whistling  
x

x
and  
x

x
gurgling  
x

x
sound  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
listen  
x

x
to. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
halted  
x

x
and  
x

x
flattened  
x

x
himself  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel-wall. 
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
weeping  
x

x
and  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
talk. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
having  
x

x
an  
x

x
argument  
x

x
with  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It’s  
x

x
no

good  
x

x
going  
x

x
back  
x

x
there  
x

to

x
  
x

x
no. 
x

x
We

doesn’t

the

places

And

it’s

“We

after

x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
whirl  
x

x
of  
x

x
hope  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wonder. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
magic  
x

x
ring:  
x

x
it  
x

x
made  
x

x
you  
x

x
invisible!  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
such  
x

x
things,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
in  
x

x
old  
x

x
old  
x

x
tales;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
hard  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
really  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
one,  
x

x
by  
x

x
accident. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
there  
x

x
it  
x

x
was:  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
bright  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
him  
x

x
by,  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
yard  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
side. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
On  
x

x
they  
x

x
went,  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
flip-flapping  
x

x
ahead,  
x

x
  
x

x
hissing  
x

x
and  
x

x
cursing;  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
behind  
x

x
going  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
softly  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
can. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
places  
x

x
where,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
down,  
x

x
side-passages  
x

x
opened,  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
began  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
to  
x

x
count  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“One  
x

x
left,  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
One  
x

x
right,  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
Two  
x

x
right,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
Two  
x

x
left,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
yes.”  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
the  
x

x
count  
x

x
grew  
x

x
he  
x

x
slowed  
x

x
down,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
shaky  
x

x
and  
x

x
weepy;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
further  
x

x
and  
x

x
further  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
afraid. 
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
about,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
low  
x

x
opening,  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
left  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Seven  
x

x
right,  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
Six  
x

x
left,  
x

x
yes!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
whispered. 
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
it. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
back-door,  
x

x
yes. 
x

x
Here’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
peered  
x

x
in,  
x

x
and  
x

x
shrank  
x

x
back. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
dursn’t  
x

x
go  
x

x
in,  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
no  
x

x
we  
x

x
dursn’t. 
x

x
  
x

x
Goblinses  
x

x
down  
x

x
there. 
x

x
Lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblinses. 
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
smells  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Ssss!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do?  
x

x
Curse  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
crush  
x

x
  
x

x
them!  
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
wait  
x

x
here,  
x

x
precious,  
x

x
wait  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
see.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
dead  
x

x
stop. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
after  
x

x
all,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
in!  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
  
x

x
humped  
x

x
up  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
gleamed  
x

x
cold  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
head,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
swayed  
x

x
it  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
side  
x

x
to  
x

x
side  
x

x
between  
x

x
his  
x

x
knees. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
crept  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
more  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
mouse;  
x

x
but  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
stiffened  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
sniffed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
went  
x

x
green. 
x

x
He  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
  
x

x
softly  
x

x
but  
x

x
menacingly. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
but  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
alert,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
senses  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
had  
x

x
sharpened:  
x

x
  
x

x
hearing  
x

x
and  
x

x
smell. 
x

x
He  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
crouched  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
down  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
flat  
x

x
hands  
x

x
splayed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
out,  
x

x
nose  
x

x
almost  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
Though  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
black  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
feel  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
tense  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
bowstring,  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
spring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
almost  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
breathing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
desperate. 
x

x
He  
x

x
must  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
away,  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
darkness,  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
strength  
x

x
left. 
x

x
He  
x

x
must  
x

x
fight. 
x

x
He  
x

x
must  
x

x
stab  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
foul  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
put  
x

x
its  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
out,  
x

x
kill  
x

x
it. 
x

x
It  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
kill  
x

x
him. 
x

x
No,  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
fight. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
invisible  
x

x
  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
sword. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
actually  
x

x
threatened  
x

x
to  
x

x
kill  
x

x
him,  
x

x
or  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
miserable,  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
lost. 
x

x
A  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
  
x

x
understanding,  
x

x
a  
x

x
pity  
x

x
mixed  
x

x
with  
x

x
horror,  
x

x
welled  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
heart:  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
of  
x

x
endless  
x

x
  
x

x
unmarked  
x

x
days  
x

x
without  
x

x
light  
x

x
or  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
betterment,  
x

x
hard  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
cold  
x

x
fish,  
x

x
sneaking  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
whispering. 
x

x
All  
x

x
these  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
passed  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
flash  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
second. 
x

x
He  
x

x
trembled. 
x

x
And  
x

x
then  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
in  
x

x
another  
x

x
flash,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
strength  
x

x
and  
x

x
resolve,  
x

x
he  
x

x
leaped. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
No  
x

x
great  
x

x
leap  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
man,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
leap  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Straight  
x

x
over  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
he  
x

x
jumped,  
x

x
  
x

x
seven  
x

x
feet  
x

x
forward  
x

x
and  
x

x
three  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air;  
x

x
indeed,  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
he  
x

x
known  
x

x
it,  
x

x
he  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
missed  
x

x
cracking  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
skull  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
low  
x

x
arch  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
threw  
x

x
himself  
x

x
backwards,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
flew  
x

x
over  
x

x
him,  
x

x
but  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
late:  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
snapped  
x

x
on  
x

x
thin  
x

x
air,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
  
x

x
falling  
x

x
fair  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
sturdy  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
sped  
x

x
off  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
new  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
turn  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
what  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
doing. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
hissing  
x

x
and  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
  
x

x
almost  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
heels  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
then  
x

x
it  
x

x
stopped. 
x

x
All  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
blood-curdling  
x

x
shriek,  
x

x
filled  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
hatred  
x

x
and  
x

x
despair. 
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
was  
x

x
defeated. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
dared  
x

x
go  
x

x
no  
x

x
further. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost:  
x

x
lost  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
prey,  
x

x
and  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
thing  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
cared  
x

x
for,  
x

x
his  
x

x
precious. 
x

x
The  
x

x
cry  
x

x
brought  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
  
x

x
heart  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth,  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
held  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
faint  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
an  
x

x
echo,  
x

x
but  
x

x
menacing,  
x

x
the  
x

x
voice  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
behind:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thief,  
x

x
thief,  
x

x
thief!  
x

x
Bag  
x

x
gins!  
x

x
We  
x

x
hates  
x

x
it,  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
hates  
x

x
it,  
x

x
we  
x

x
hates  
x

x
it  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
silence. 
x

x
But  
x

x
that  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
menacing  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
are  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
near  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
smelt  
x

x
them,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
“then  
x

x
they’ll  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
his  
x

x
shrieking  
x

x
and  
x

x
cursing. 
x

x
Careful  
x

x
  
x

x
now,  
x

x
or  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
will  
x

x
lead  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
worse  
x

x
things.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
passage  
x

x
was  
x

x
low  
x

x
and  
x

x
roughly  
x

x
made. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
too  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
except  
x

x
when,  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
care,  
x

x
he  
x

x
stubbed  
x

x
his  
x

x
poor  
x

x
toes  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
several  
x

x
times,  
x

x
on  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
jagged  
x

x
stones  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor. 
x

x
“A  
x

x
bit  
x

x
low  
x

x
for  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
big  
x

x
ones,”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
not  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
that  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
big  
x

x
ones,  
x

x
the  
x

x
ores  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
speed  
x

x
stooping  
x

x
low  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
hands  
x

x
almost  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
sloping  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
up  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
steeply. 
x

x
That  
x

x
slowed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
down. 
x

x
But  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
the  
x

x
slope  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
turned  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
corner  
x

x
and  
x

x
dipped  
x

x
down  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there,  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
incline,  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw,  
x

x
filtering  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
another  
x

x
corner  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
of  
x

x
light. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
  
x

x
red  
x

x
light,  
x

x
as  
x

x
of  
x

x
fire  
x

x
or  
x

x
lantern,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
pale  
x

x
out-of-  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
light. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
run. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Scuttling  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
would  
x

x
carry  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
corner  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
into  
x

x
an  
x

x
open  
x

x
space,  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
light,  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
dazzlingly  
x

x
  
x

x
bright. 
x

x
Really  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
leak  
x

x
of  
x

x
sunshine  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
a  
x

x
doorway,  
x

x
where  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
door,  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone  
x

x
  
x

x
door,  
x

x
was  
x

x
left  
x

x
standing  
x

x
open. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
blinked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins:  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
in  
x

x
full  
x

x
armour  
x

x
with  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
  
x

x
swords  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
just  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
watching  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
wide  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
watching  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
led  
x

x
to  
x

x
it. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
aroused,  
x

x
alert,  
x

x
ready  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
anything. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
saw  
x

x
him  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
Yes,  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Whether  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
accident,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
last  
x

x
trick  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
master,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
finger. 
x

x
With  
x

x
yells  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
delight  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
upon  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
pang  
x

x
of  
x

x
fear  
x

x
and  
x

x
loss,  
x

x
like  
x

x
an  
x

x
echo  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Gollum’s  
x

x
misery,  
x

x
smote  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
forgetting  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
draw  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
he  
x

x
struck  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
pockets. 
x

x
And  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
still,  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
pocket,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
finger. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
short. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
vanished. 
x

x
They  
x

x
yelled  
x

x
twice  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
loud  
x

x
as  
x

x
before,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
delightedly. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Go  
x

x
back  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage!”  
x

x
some  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
way!”  
x

x
some  
x

x
yelled. 
x

x
“That  
x

x
way!”  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
yelled. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Look  
x

x
out  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,”  
x

x
bellowed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
captain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Whistles  
x

x
blew,  
x

x
armour  
x

x
clashed,  
x

x
swords  
x

x
  
x

x
rattled,  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
cursed  
x

x
and  
x

x
swore  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
hither  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
thither,  
x

x
falling  
x

x
over  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
and  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
angry. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
outcry,  
x

x
to-do,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
disturbance. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
frightened,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sense  
x

x
to  
x

x
understand  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
sneak  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
which  
x

x
held  
x

x
  
x

x
drink  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-guards,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
and  
x

x
avoid  
x

x
being  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
into,  
x

x
trampled  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
death,  
x

x
or  
x

x
caught  
x

x
by  
x

x
feel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
must  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
I  
x

x
must  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
saying  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
ventured  
x

x
to  
x

x
try. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
game  
x

x
of  
x

x
blind-man’s-buff. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
place  
x

x
was  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
running  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
dodged  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
and  
x

x
that,  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
knocked  
x

x
over  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
who  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
make  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
into,  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
all  
x

x
fours,  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
legs  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
captain  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time,  
x

x
got  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
ajar,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
had  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
to. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
struggled  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
move  
x

x
  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
squeeze  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
squeezed  
x

x
and  
x

x
squeezed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
stuck!  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
awful. 
x

x
His  
x

x
buttons  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
wedged  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
door-post. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
outside  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
open  
x

x
air:  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
steps  
x

x
running  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
valley  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
tall  
x

x
mountains;  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
cloud  
x

x
and  
x

x
shone  
x

x
bright  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
outside  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
through. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
inside  
x

x
shouted:  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Something  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
outside!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
heart  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrific  
x

x
squirm. 
x

x
Buttons  
x

x
burst  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
directions. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
through,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
torn  
x

x
coat  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
waistcoat,  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
steps  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
goat,  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
bewildered  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
picking  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
nice  
x

x
brass  
x

x
buttons  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorstep. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
they  
x

x
soon  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
after  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
hooting  
x

x
and  
x

x
hallooing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun:  
x

x
it  
x

x
makes  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
legs  
x

x
wobble  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
giddy. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
find  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
on,  
x

x
slipping  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
running  
x

x
quick  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
quiet,  
x

x
and  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun;  
x

x
so  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
and  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
to  
x

x
guard  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped. 
x

x

Chapter  
x

x
VI  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
OUT  
x

x
OF  
x

x
THE  
x

x
FRYING-PAN  
x

x
INTO  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
THE  
x

x
FIRE  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
was. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
hood,  
x

x
cloak,  
x

x
  
x

x
food,  
x

x
pony,  
x

x
his  
x

x
buttons  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on,  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sink  
x

x
  
x

x
westwards  
x

x
—  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
fell  
x

x
across  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
path,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
  
x

x
back. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
forward  
x

x
and  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
him  
x

x
only  
x

x
ridges  
x

x
and  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
falling  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
lowlands  
x

x
and  
x

x
plains  
x

x
glimpsed  
x

x
  
x

x
occasionally  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
heavens!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
exclaimed. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountains,  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Land  
x

x
  
x

x
Beyond!  
x

x
Where  
x

x
and  
x

x
O  
x

x
where  
x

x
can  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to?  
x

x
I  
x

x
only  
x

x
hope  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
still  
x

x
back  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
power  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
still  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
on,  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
high  
x

x
  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
over  
x

x
its  
x

x
edge,  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond;  
x

x
but  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
while  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
was  
x

x
growing  
x

x
inside  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
ought  
x

x
not,  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
magic  
x

x
  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
horrible,  
x

x
horrible,  
x

x
  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
and  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
duty,  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
turn  
x

x
back  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
voices. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
and  
x

x
listened. 
x

x
It  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
sound  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
goblins;  
x

x
so  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
forward  
x

x
carefully. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
stony  
x

x
path  
x

x
winding  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
wall  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
hand;  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground  
x

x
sloped  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
dells  
x

x
below  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
level  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
overhung  
x

x
with  
x

x
bushes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
low  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
In  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
dells  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
bushes  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
were  
x

x
talking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
crept  
x

x
still  
x

x
nearer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
peering  
x

x
between  
x

x
two  
x

x
big  
x

x
boulders  
x

x
a  
x

x
head  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
hood  
x

x
on:  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
doing  
x

x
look-out. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
clapped  
x

x
and  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
for  
x

x
joy,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
still  
x

x
got  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
on,  
x

x
for  
x

x
fear  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
meeting  
x

x
something  
x

x
unexpected  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
unpleasant,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
was  
x

x
looking  
x

x
  
x

x
straight  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
without  
x

x
noticing  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
a  
x

x
surprise,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
crawled  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
bushes  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dell. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
arguing  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
discussing  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
debating  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
now. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
grumbling,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
saying  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
possibly  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hands  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
without  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
out  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
alive  
x

x
or  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
and  
x

x
without  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
rescue  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“After  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
my  
x

x
friend,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
little  
x

x
chap. 
x

x
I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
responsible  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
lost  
x

x
him.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
been  
x

x
brought  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
stick  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
and  
x

x
come  
x

x
along  
x

x
with  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
why  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
chosen  
x

x
someone  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
sense. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
more  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
use  
x

x
so  
x

x
far,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
one. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
into  
x

x
those  
x

x
abominable  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
then  
x

x
drat  
x

x
him,  
x

x
I  
x

x
say.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
answered  
x

x
angrily:  
x

x
“I  
x

x
brought  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
bring  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
of  
x

x
no  
x

x
use. 
x

x
Either  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
help  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
him,  
x

x
or  
x

x
I  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
leave  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
here  
x

x
to  
x

get

out

of

the

as

best  
x

x
you

can

yourselves. 
x

x
If

we

can

only  
x

x
find  
x

x
him  
x

x
again,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
thank  
x

x
me  
x

x
before  
x

x
all

is  
x

x
over. 
x

x
Whatever

did  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
want

to

go

and

him

for,

Dori?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
him,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
  
x

x
“if  
x

x
a  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
had  
x

x
suddenly

grabbed

your

legs

from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
in  
x

x
the

dark,

tripped  
x

up

your

feet,  
x

and

you

the

back!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Then  
x

why  
x

x
didn’t  
x

x
you

pick  
x

him  
x

up

again?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
heavens!  
x

x
Can  
x

x
you  
x

x
ask!  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
fighting

and

biting  
x

in

the

dark,

everybody

falling

over

bodies

and

hitting

one

another!  
x

x
You  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
  
x

x
chopped  
x

x
off  
x

x
my  
x

head

with  
x

x
Glamdring,

and  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

stabbing  
x

x
here

there  
x

x
and  
x

x
everywhere  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
Orcrist. 
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
you  
x

x
gave  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
blinding  
x

x
flashes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
running  
x

x
back  
x

x
yelping. 
x

x
You  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
‘follow  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
everybody!'  
x

x
and  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
followed. 
x

x
We  
x

x
thought  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
had. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
count,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
quite  
x

x
well,  
x

x
till  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
dashed  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate-guards,  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
lower  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
helter-skelter  
x

x
down  
x

x
here. 
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
—  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar,  
x

x
confusticate  
x

x
  
x

x
him!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
here’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
stepping  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
slipping  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bless  
x

x
me,  
x

x
how  
x

x
they  
x

x
jumped!  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
with  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
and  
x

x
delight. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
astonished  
x

x
as  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
but  
x

x
probably  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
than  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
He  
x

x
called  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
and  
x

x
told  
x

x
him  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
look-out  
x

x
  
x

x
man  
x

x
who  
x

x
let  
x

x
people  
x

x
walk  
x

x
right  
x

x
into  
x

x
them  
x

x
like  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
warning. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
fact  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
  
x

x
reputation  
x

x
went  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
great  
x

x
deal  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
after  
x

x
this. 
x

x
If  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
still  
x

x
doubted  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
a  
x

x
first-class  
x

x
burglar,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
s  
x

x
words,  
x

x
they  
x

x
doubted  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
puzzled  
x

x
of  
x

x
all;  
x

x
but  
x

x
everyone  
x

x
said  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
clever  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
work. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
praise  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
just  
x

x
chuckled  
x

x
inside  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring;  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
him  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
it,  
x

x
he  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“Oh,  
x

x
just  
x

x
crept  
x

x
  
x

x
along,  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
—  
x

x
very  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
and  
x

x
quietly.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
that  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
mouse  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
crept  
x

x
along  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
and  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
under  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
nose  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
spotted,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
take  
x

x
off  
x

x
my  
x

x
hood  
x

x
to  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
Which  
x

x
he  
x

x
did. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Balin  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Your  
x

x
servant,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
after  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
everything  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
finding  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
(“not  
x

x
just  
x

x
now”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought). 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
interested  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
riddle-  
x

x
  
x

x
competition,  
x

x
and  
x

x
shuddered  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
appreciatively  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
description  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gollum. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
then  
x

x
I  
x

x
couldn’t  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
question  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
beside  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
ended  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo;  
x

x
“so  
x

x
I  
x

x
said  
x

x
‘what’s  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
pocket?’  
x

x
And  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
couldn’t  
x

x
guess  
x

x
in  
x

x
three  
x

x
goes. 
x

x
So  
x

x
I  
x

x
said:  
x

x
‘what  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
your  
x

x
promise?  
x

x
Show  
x

x
me  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out!’  
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
at  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
kill  
x

x
me,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
ran,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
over,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
missed  
x

x
me  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
him,  
x

x
because  
x

x
I  
x

x
heard  
x

x
him  
x

x
talking  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
I  
x

x
really  
x

x
knew  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
making  
x

x
for  
x

x
it. 
x

x
And  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
entrance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
by. 
x

x
So  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
over  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
escaped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Weren’t  
x

x
there  
x

x
any?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
yes!  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
them;  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
dodged  
x

x
’em. 
x

x
I  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
open  
x

x
a  
x

x
crack,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
lost  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
buttons,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
sadly  
x

x
looking  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
torn  
x

x
clothes. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
I  
x

x
squeezed  
x

x
through  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
here  
x

x
lam.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
respect,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
talked  
x

x
about  
x

x
dodging  
x

x
guards,  
x

x
  
x

x
jumping  
x

x
over  
x

x
Gollum,  
x

x
and  
x

x
squeezing  
x

x
through,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
or  
x

x
very  
x

x
alarming. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
did  
x

x
I  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
laughing. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
has  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
guess.”  
x

x
He  
x

x
gave  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
a  
x

x
queer  
x

x
look  
x

x
from  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
bushy  
x

x
eyebrows,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
this,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
tale  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
out. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
questions  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
if  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
explained  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
by  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
heard  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
how  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
had  
x

x
turned  
x

x
up  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
now. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth,  
x

x
never  
x

x
minded  
x

x
  
x

x
explaining  
x

x
his  
x

x
cleverness  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
once,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
told  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
that  
x

x
both  
x

x
he  
x

x
and  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
well  
x

x
aware  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
presence  
x

x
of  
x

x
evil  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
But  
x

x
their  
x

x
main  
x

x
gate  
x

x
  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
different  
x

x
pass,  
x

x
one  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
easy  
x

x
to  
x

x
travel  
x

x
by,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
often  
x

x
caught  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
benighted  
x

x
near  
x

x
their  
x

x
gates. 
x

x
Evidently  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
up  
x

x
going  
x

x
that  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
opened  
x

x
their  
x

x
new  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
pass  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
taken,  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
recently,  
x

x
because  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
found  
x

x
quite  
x

x
safe  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
now. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
must  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
find  
x

x
a  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
decent  
x

x
giant  
x

x
to  
x

x
block  
x

x
it  
x

x
up  
x

x
again,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
  
x

x
‘‘or  
x

x
soon  
x

x
there  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
getting  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
at  
x

x
all.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
yell  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
realized  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
flash  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
killed  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
grabbing  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
nipped  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack,  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
snapped  
x

x
to. 
x

x
He  
x

x
followed  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
drivers  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
worked  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
very  
x

x
ticklish  
x

x
business,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
‘‘Touch  
x

x
and  
x

x
go!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
special  
x

x
  
x

x
study  
x

x
of  
x

x
bewitchments  
x

x
with  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
lights  
x

x
(even  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
the  
x

x
magic  
x

x
  
x

x
fireworks  
x

x
at  
x

x
Old  
x

x
Took’s  
x

x
midsummer-eve  
x

x
  
x

x
parties,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
remember). 
x

x
The  
x

x
rest  
x

x
we  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
knew  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
back-door,  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
called  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
gate,  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
lost  
x

x
his  
x

x
buttons. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
well  
x

x
known  
x

x
to  
x

x
anybody  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
acquainted  
x

x
with  
x

x
this  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
guide  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
made  
x

x
that  
x

x
gate  
x

x
ages  
x

x
ago,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
“partly  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
escape,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
needed  
x

x
one;  
x

x
  
x

x
partly  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
beyond,  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
still  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
do  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
damage. 
x

x
They  
x

x
guard  
x

x
it  
x

x
always  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
block  
x

x
it  
x

x
up. 
x

x
They  
x

x
will  
x

x
guard  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
doubly  
x

x
after  
x

x
this,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
laughed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
too. 
x

x
After  
x

x
all  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
lost  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
killed  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
many  
x

x
others  
x

x
besides,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
escaped,  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
so  
x

x
far. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
called  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
senses. 
x

x
  
x

x
‘‘We  
x

x
must  
x

be  
x

getting  
x

x
on  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,  
x

x
now  
x

x
we  
x

are  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
rested,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“They

will  
x

be  
x

out  
x

x
after

us

in

hundreds

when

night

on;

and

already

shadows

are  
x

lengthening. 
x

x
They

can

smell  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
footsteps  
x

x
for  
x

x
hours  
x

x
and  
x

x
hours  
x

x
after  
x

x
we

have  
x

x
  
x

x
passed. 
x

x
We

must

be  
x

x
miles  
x

x
on  
x

x
before  
x

x
dusk. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

will  
x

be  
x

x
a

bit

of

moon,

if

it

keeps  
x

x
fine,

and  
x

x
  
x

x
that

is  
x

x
lucky. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
that

they

mind  
x

x
the

moon  
x

x
much,

but  
x

it

will

give

us  
x

x
a

little

light

to

by.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

“O

yes!”  
x

x
he

said

in

answer

to  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
questions

from

the

hobbit. 
x

x
“You

track

of

time

goblin-tunnels. 
x

x
Today’s  
x

x
Thursday,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
Monday  
x

x
night  
x

x
or  
x

x
Tuesday  
x

x
morning  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
captured. 
x

x
We  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
miles  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
miles,

and  
x

come

right

down

through  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
now  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
—  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
cut. 
x

x
But  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the

point

to  
x

which

our

pass

would

have

brought

x
  
x

x
us;

x
we

are

too  
x

x
far  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
North,  
x

x
and

have  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
awkward  
x

x
country  
x

x
ahead. 
x

x
And  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
still  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
up. 
x

x
Let’s  
x

x
get  
x

x
on!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
hungry,”  
x

x
groaned  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
aware  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
meal  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before  
x

x
last. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit!  
x

x
His  
x

x
stomach  
x

x
felt  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
empty  
x

x
and  
x

x
loose  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
all  
x

x
wobbly,  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
was  
x

x
over. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Can't  
x

x
help  
x

x
it,’’  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
“unless  
x

x
you  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
ask  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
nicely  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
your  
x

x
pony  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
luggage.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
thank  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well  
x

x
then,  
x

x
we  
x

x
must  
x

x
just  
x

x
tighten  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
belts  
x

x
and  
x

x
trudge  
x

x
on  
x

x
—  
x

x
or  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
made  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
much  
x

x
worse  
x

x
than  
x

x
having  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
ourselves.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
looked  
x

x
from  
x

x
side  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
side  
x

x
for  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
blackberries  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
only  
x

x
in  
x

x
flower,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
nuts,  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
hawthorn-berries. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
nibbled  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
sorrel,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
drank  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
small  
x

x
mountain-stream  
x

x
that  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
the  
x

x
path,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
ate  
x

x
three  
x

x
wild  
x

x
strawberries  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
good. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
still  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rough  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
disappeared. 
x

x
The  
x

x
bushes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
grasses  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
boulders,  
x

x
the  
x

x
patches  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
rabbit-cropped  
x

x
turf,  
x

x
the  
x

x
thyme  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
sage  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
marjoram,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
rockroses  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
vanished,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
steep  
x

x
slope  
x

x
of  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
stones,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
remains  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
landslide. 
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
this,  
x

x
rubbish  
x

x
and  
x

x
small  
x

x
pebbles  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet;  
x

x
soon  
x

x
larger  
x

x
bits  
x

x
of  
x

x
split  
x

x
  
x

x
stone  
x

x
went  
x

x
clattering  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
started  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
pieces  
x

x
below  
x

x
them  
x

x
slithering  
x

x
and  
x

x
rolling;  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
lumps  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
were  
x

x
disturbed  
x

x
and  
x

x
bounded  
x

x
off,  
x

x
  
x

x
crashing  
x

x
down  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
dust  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
noise. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
slope  
x

x
above  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
below  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
move,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
sliding  
x

x
away,  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
all  
x

x
together,  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
fearful  
x

x
  
x

x
confusion  
x

x
of  
x

x
slipping,  
x

x
rattling,  
x

x
cracking  
x

x
slabs  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
stones. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom  
x

x
that  
x

x
saved  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
slid  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
  
x

x
wood  
x

x
of  
x

x
pines  
x

x
that  
x

x
here  
x

x
stood  
x

x
right  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
slope  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
deeper  
x

x
darker  
x

x
forests  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
valleys  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
caught  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trunks  
x

x
and  
x

x
swung  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
into  
x

x
lower  
x

x
  
x

x
branches,  
x

x
some  
x

x
(like  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit)  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
to  
x

x
shelter  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
onslaught  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
danger  
x

x
was  
x

x
over,  
x

x
the  
x

x
slide  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
faint  
x

x
crashes  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
heard  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
largest  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
disturbed  
x

x
stones  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
bounding  
x

x
and  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bracken  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
pine-roots  
x

x
far  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well!  
x

x
that  
x

x
has  
x

x
got  
x

x
us  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf;  
x

x
“and  
x

x
even  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
tracking  
x

x
us  
x

x
will  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
job  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
down  
x

x
here  
x

x
quietly.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
daresay,”  
x

x
grumbled  
x

x
Bombur;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
find  
x

x
it  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
to  
x

x
send  
x

x
stones  
x

x
bouncing  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
our  
x

x
heads.”  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
(and  
x

x
Bilbo)  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
happy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
rubbing  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
bruised  
x

x
and  
x

x
damaged  
x

x
legs  
x

x
and  
x

x
feet. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Nonsense!  
x

x
We  
x

x
are  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn  
x

x
aside  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
slide. 
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
quick!  
x

x
Look  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
light!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
gone  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
deepening  
x

x
about  
x

x
them,  
x

x
though  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
black  
x

x
tops  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
growing  
x

x
lower  
x

x
down  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
still  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
evening  
x

x
lights  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
plains  
x

x
beyond. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
limped  
x

x
along  
x

x
now  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
able  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
gentle  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
pine  
x

x
forest  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
slanting  
x

x
path  
x

x
leading  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
southwards. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
times  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
pushing  
x

x
through  
x

x
a  
x

x
sea  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
bracken  
x

x
with  
x

x
tall  
x

x
fronds  
x

x
rising  
x

x
right  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
head;  
x

x
at  
x

x
times  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
marching  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
as  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
over  
x

x
a  
x

x
floor  
x

x
of  
x

x
pine-  
x

x
  
x

x
needles;  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-gloom  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
heavier  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-silence  
x

x
deeper. 
x

x
There  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
wind  
x

x
that  
x

x
evening  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
sea-  
x

x
  
x

x
sighing  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Must  
x

x
we  
x

x
go  
x

x
any  
x

x
further?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
when  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
dark  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
see  
x

x
Thorin's  
x

x
  
x

x
beard  
x

x
wagging  
x

x
beside  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves’  
x

x
breathing  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
  
x

x
noise. 
x

x
“My  
x

x
toes  
x

x
are  
x

x
all  
x

x
bruised  
x

x
and  
x

x
bent,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
legs  
x

x
ache,  
x

x
and  
x

x
my  
x

x
stomach  
x

x
is  
x

x
wagging  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
empty  
x

x
sack.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
bit  
x

x
further,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
what  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
ages  
x

x
further  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
opening  
x

x
where  
x

x
no  
x

x
trees  
x

x
grew. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
moon  
x

x
was  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
shining  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
clearing. 
x

x
Somehow  
x

x
it  
x

x
struck  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
a  
x

x
nice  
x

x
place,  
x

x
although  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
wrong  
x

x
to  
x

x
see. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
a  
x

x
howl  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
hill,  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
shuddering  
x

x
howl. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
by  
x

x
another  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
to  
x

x
them;  
x

x
then  
x

x
by  
x

x
another  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
left. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
howling  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
moon,  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
gathering  
x

x
together!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
living  
x

x
near  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
hole  
x

x
at  
x

x
home,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
noise. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
it  
x

x
described  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
often  
x

x
enough  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
tales. 
x

x
One  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
elder  
x

x
cousins  
x

x
(on  
x

x
the  
x

x
Took  
x

x
  
x

x
side),  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
traveller,  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
imitate  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
frighten  
x

x
him. 
x

x
To  
x

x
hear  
x

x
it  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
much  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
magic  
x

x
rings  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
use  
x

x
against  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
—  
x

x
especially  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
evil  
x

x
packs  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
lived  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-infested  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
Edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
unknown. 
x

x
Wolves  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
sort  
x

x
  
x

x
smell  
x

x
keener  
x

x
than  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
need  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
catch  
x

x
you!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do,  
x

x
what  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“Escaping  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
caught  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
became  
x

x
a  
x

x
proverb,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
we  
x

x
now  
x

x
say  
x

x
“out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
frying-pan  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fire”  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
  
x

x
situations. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Up  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
quick!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Gandalf;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
ran  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
glade,  
x

x
  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
for  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
branches  
x

x
fairly  
x

x
low,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
slender  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
swarm  
x

x
up. 
x

x
They  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
they  
x

x
could,  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
guess;  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
as  
x

x
high  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
trust  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches. 
x

x
You  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
(from  
x

x
a  
x

x
safe  
x

x
distance),  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
beards  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
down,  
x

x
like  
x

x
old  
x

x
gentlemen  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
cracked  
x

x
and  
x

x
playing  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
boys. 
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
tall  
x

x
larch  
x

x
like  
x

x
an  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
  
x

x
Christmas  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
Ori,  
x

x
Oin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
more  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
huge  
x

x
pine  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
regular  
x

x
branches  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
out  
x

x
at  
x

x
intervals  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spokes  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
wheel. 
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
another. 
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
swarmed  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
tall  
x

x
slender  
x

x
fir  
x

x
with  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
branches  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
greenery  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
topmost  
x

x
boughs. 
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
taller  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
others,  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
into  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
climb,  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
large  
x

x
pine  
x

x
standing  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
glade. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
boughs,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
gleaming  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
peeped  
x

x
out. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
Bilbo?  
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
into  
x

x
any  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
scuttling  
x

x
about  
x

x
from  
x

x
trunk  
x

x
to  
x

x
trunk,  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit  
x

x
that  
x

x
has  
x

x
lost  
x

x
its  
x

x
hole  
x

x
and  
x

x
has  
x

x
a  
x

x
dog  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You’ve  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
behind  
x

x
again!’’  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Nori  
x

x
to  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
looking  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
always  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
burglars  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
back,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
“down  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
trees!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
What  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
am?  
x

x
A  
x

x
porter?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He’ll  
x

x
be  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
don't  
x

x
do  
x

x
something,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
for  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
howls  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
now,  
x

x
getting  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearer. 
x

x
“Dori!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
called,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
was  
x

x
lowest  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
easiest  
x

x
  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
“be  
x

x
quick,  
x

x
and  
x

x
give  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
a  
x

x
hand  
x

x
  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
a  
x

x
decent  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
grumbling. 
x

x
Poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
reach  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hand  
x

x
even  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom  
x

x
  
x

x
branch  
x

x
and  
x

x
hung  
x

x
his  
x

x
arm  
x

x
down  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could. 
x

x
So  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
actually  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tree  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
scramble  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
stand  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
  
x

x
howling  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
clearing. 
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
let  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
down. 
x

x
He  
x

x
waited  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
clambered  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
shoulders  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
branches,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time!  
x

x
A  
x

x
wolf  
x

x
snapped  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
swung  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
got  
x

x
him. 
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
minute  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
whole  
x

x
pack  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
yelping  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
up  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
trunk,  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
blazing  
x

x
and  
x

x
tongues  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
out. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
wild  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
(for  
x

x
so  
x

x
the  
x

x
evil  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
Edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild  
x

x
were  
x

x
named)  
x

x
  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
climb  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
For  
x

x
a  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
safe. 
x

x
  
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
warm  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
windy. 
x

x
Trees  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
in  
x

x
for  
x

x
long  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
time;  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
with  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
below  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
you,  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
perfectly  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
places. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
glade  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
trees  
x

x
was  
x

x
evidently  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
meeting-place  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves. 
x

x
More  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
coming  
x

x
in. 
x

x
They  
x

x
left  
x

x
guards  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
foot  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
were,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
snuffling  
x

x
about  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
smelt  
x

x
out  
x

x
every  
x

x
  
x

x
tree  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
in  
x

x
it. 
x

x
These  
x

x
they  
x

x
guarded  
x

x
  
x

x
too,  
x

x
while  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
(hundreds  
x

x
and  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed)  
x

x
went  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
circle  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
glade;  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
grey  
x

x
wolf. 
x

x
He  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
language  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
understood  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
did  
x

x
not,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
talk  
x

x
was  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
cruel  
x

x
and  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
things,  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
was. 
x

x
Every  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
answer  
x

x
their  
x

x
grey  
x

x
chief  
x

x
all  
x

x
together,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
clamour  
x

x
almost  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
fall  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
pine-tree. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
what  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
heard,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
understand  
x

x
it. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
often  
x

x
helped  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
in  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
  
x

x
deeds. 
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
usually  
x

x
venture  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
driven  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
new  
x

x
homes,  
x

x
or  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
marching  
x

x
to  
x

x
war  
x

x
(which  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
has  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
happened  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while). 
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
raids,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
food  
x

x
or  
x

x
slaves  
x

x
to  
x

x
work  
x

x
for  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
often  
x

x
got  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
and  
x

x
shared  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
plunder  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Sometimes  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
like  
x

x
men  
x

x
do  
x

x
on  
x

x
horses. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
goblin-raid  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
planned  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
very  
x

x
night. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
late. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
reason,  
x

x
no  
x

x
doubt,  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
caused  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
for  
x

x
whom  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
probably  
x

x
still  
x

x
hunting. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dangers  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
far  
x

x
land  
x

x
bold  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
had  
x

x
of  
x

x
late  
x

x
been  
x

x
making  
x

x
their  
x

x
way  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
it  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
South,  
x

x
cutting  
x

x
down  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
building  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
places  
x

x
to  
x

x
live  
x

x
in  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
woods  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valleys  
x

x
and  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
river-shores. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
brave  
x

x
and  
x

x
well-armed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
dared  
x

x
not  
x

x
attack  
x

x
them  
x

x
if  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
together,  
x

x
or  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
bright  
x

x
day. 
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
planned  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins’  
x

x
help  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
upon  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
villages  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
If  
x

x
their  
x

x
plan  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
carried  
x

x
out,  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
none  
x

x
left  
x

x
there  
x

x
next  
x

x
day;  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
killed  
x

x
except  
x

x
the  
x

x
few  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
kept  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
carried  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
caves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
talk  
x

x
to  
x

x
listen  
x

x
to,  
x

x
not  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
brave  
x

x
woodmen  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
wives  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
children,  
x

x
but  
x

x
also  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
danger  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
now  
x

x
threatened  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
were  
x

x
angry  
x

x
and  
x

x
puzzled  
x

x
at  
x

x
finding  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
here  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
very  
x

x
meeting-place. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
friends  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
woodmen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
spy  
x

x
on  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
take  
x

x
  
x

x
news  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
plans  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valleys,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
fight  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
battle  
x

x
instead  
x

x
of  
x

x
capturing  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
and  
x

x
devouring  
x

x
people  
x

x
waked  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
sleep. 
x

x
So  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
intention  
x

x
of  
x

x
going  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
letting  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
escape,  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
not  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
And  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
that,  
x

x
they  
x

x
said,  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
  
x

x
soldiers  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
coming  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains;  
x

x
and  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
can  
x

x
climb  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
or  
x

x
cut  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
understand  
x

x
why  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
  
x

x
listening  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
growling  
x

x
and  
x

x
yelping,  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
dreadfully  
x

x
afraid,  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
was,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
bad  
x

x
place,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
them  
x

x
have  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
way,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
do  
x

x
very  
x

x
much  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tall  
x

x
tree  
x

x
with  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
  
x

x
below. 
x

x
He  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
the  
x

x
huge  
x

x
pine-cones  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
set  
x

x
one  
x

x
alight  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
bright  
x

x
blue  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
threw  
x

x
it  
x

x
whizzing  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves. 
x

x
It  
x

x
struck  
x

x
one  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
his  
x

x
shaggy  
x

x
coat  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
to  
x

x
and  
x

x
fro  
x

x
  
x

x
yelping  
x

x
horribly. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
another  
x

x
came  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
another,  
x

x
one  
x

x
in  
x

x
blue  
x

x
flames,  
x

x
one  
x

x
in  
x

x
red,  
x

x
another  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
green. 
x

x
They  
x

x
burst  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
coloured  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
smoke. 
x

x
A  
x

x
specially  
x

x
large  
x

x
one  
x

x
hit  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
wolf  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
nose,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
ten  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
  
x

x
biting  
x

x
and  
x

x
snapping  
x

x
even  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
anger  
x

x
and  
x

x
fright. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cheered. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rage  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
was  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
see,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
filled  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
Wolves  
x

x
are  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
of  
x

x
fire  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
times,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
and  
x

x
uncanny  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
If  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
spark  
x

x
got  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
coats  
x

x
it  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
and  
x

x
burned  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
unless  
x

x
they  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
over  
x

x
quick  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
soon  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
glade  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
were  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
to  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs,  
x

x
while  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
burning  
x

x
were  
x

x
running  
x

x
about  
x

x
howling  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
setting  
x

x
others  
x

x
alight,  
x

x
till  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
friends  
x

x
chased  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
fled  
x

x
off  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
  
x

x
crying  
x

x
and  
x

x
yammering  
x

x
and  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
water. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"What  
x

x
is  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
uproar  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
tonight?”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
sitting,  
x

x
  
x

x
black  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
moonlight,  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
  
x

x
pinnacle  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
hear  
x

x
wolves’  
x

x
voices!  
x

x
Are  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
at  
x

x
mischief  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
swept  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air,  
x

x
and  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
guards  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
at  
x

x
either  
x

x
hand  
x

x
  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
follow  
x

x
him. 
x

x
They  
x

x
circled  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sky  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
down  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Wargs,  
x

x
a  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
spot  
x

x
far  
x

x
far  
x

x
below. 
x

x
But  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
keen  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
and  
x

x
can  
x

x
see  
x

x
small  
x

x
things  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
distance. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
had  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
that  
x

x
could  
x

x
look  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sun  
x

x
unblinking,  
x

x
and  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit  
x

x
moving  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
a  
x

x
mile  
x

x
below  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
moonlight. 
x

x
So  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
make  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
  
x

x
flashes  
x

x
of  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
howling  
x

x
and  
x

x
yelping  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
faint  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
glint  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
on  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
spears  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
helmets,  
x

x
as  
x

x
long  
x

x
lines  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
folk  
x

x
  
x

x
crept  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
hillsides  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wound  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
kindly  
x

x
birds. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
cowardly  
x

x
and  
x

x
cruel. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
race  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
northern  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
greatest  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
birds;  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
proud  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
and  
x

x
noble-  
x

x
  
x

x
hearted. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
love  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
or  
x

x
fear  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
any  
x

x
notice  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
(which  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
seldom,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
eat  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
creatures),  
x

x
they  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
drove  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
shrieking  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
caves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
wickedness  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
doing. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
hated  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
and  
x

x
feared  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
reach  
x

x
their  
x

x
lofty  
x

x
seats,  
x

x
or  
x

x
drive  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Tonight  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
curiosity  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
afoot;  
x

x
so  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
summoned  
x

x
many  
x

x
other  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
flew  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
circling  
x

x
ever  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
down,  
x

x
  
x

x
down,  
x

x
down  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
meeting-place  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
very  
x

x
good  
x

x
thing  
x

x
too!  
x

x
Dreadful  
x

x
things  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
down  
x

x
there. 
x

x
The  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
fled  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
had  
x

x
set  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
alight  
x

x
in  
x

x
several  
x

x
places,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
high  
x

x
summer,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
this  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
little  
x

x
rain  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Yellowing  
x

x
  
x

x
bracken,  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
branches,  
x

x
deep-piled  
x

x
pine-  
x

x
  
x

x
needles,  
x

x
and  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
dead  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
in  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
All  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
clearing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
fire  
x

x
was  
x

x
leaping. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolf-guards  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
leave  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
Maddened  
x

x
and  
x

x
angry  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
and  
x

x
howling  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
trunks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
language,  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
tongues  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
shining  
x

x
as  
x

x
red  
x

x
and  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
came  
x

x
running  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
yelling. 
x

x
They  
x

x
thought  
x

x
a  
x

x
battle  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
woodmen  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
on;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
soon  
x

x
learned  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
happened. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
actually  
x

x
sat  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughed. 
x

x
Others  
x

x
waved  
x

x
their  
x

x
spears  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
clashed  
x

x
the  
x

x
shafts  
x

x
against  
x

x
their  
x

x
shields. 
x

x
  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
of  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
soon  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
plan  
x

x
which  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
most  
x

x
amusing. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
got  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
together  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pack. 
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
stacked  
x

x
fern  
x

x
and  
x

x
brushwood  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tree-trunks. 
x

x
Others  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
stamped  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
beat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
beat  
x

x
and  
x

x
stamped,  
x

x
until  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
flames  
x

x
were  
x

x
put  
x

x
out  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were. 
x

x
That  
x

x
fire  
x

x
they  
x

x
fed  
x

x
with  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
dead  
x

x
branches  
x

x
and  
x

x
bracken. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
and  
x

x
flame  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
kept  
x

x
from  
x

x
spreading  
x

x
outwards;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
closed  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
in,  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
running  
x

x
fire  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
licking  
x

x
the  
x

x
fuel  
x

x
piled  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
Smoke  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
the  
x

x
heat  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
flames;  
x

x
and  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
reek  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
circle  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
people  
x

x
round  
x

x
a  
x

x
midsummer  
x

x
bonfire. 
x

x
  
x

x
Outside  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
of  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
with  
x

x
spears  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
axes  
x

x
stood  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
respectful  
x

x
  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
watching  
x

x
and  
x

x
waiting. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
song:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fifteen  
x

x
birds  
x

x
in  
x

x
five  
x

x
fir-trees,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
feathers  
x

x
were  
x

x
fanned  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
fiery  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
breeze!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But,  
x

x
funny  
x

x
little  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
wings!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
O  
x

x
what  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
funny  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
things?  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Roast  
x

x
’em  
x

x
alive,  
x

x
orstewthem  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pot;  
x

x
  
x

x
fry  
x

x
them,  
x

x
boil  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
eat  
x

x
them  
x

x
hot?  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
and  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
out:  
x

x
“Fly  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
little  
x

x
birds!  
x

x
Fly  
x

x
away  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
can!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
little  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
or  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
roasted  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
nests!  
x

x
Sing,  
x

x
sing  
x

x
little  
x

x
birds!  
x

x
Why  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
sing?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Go  
x

x
away!  
x

x
little  
x

x
boys!”  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
isn’t  
x

x
bird-nesting  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
naughty  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
boys  
x

x
that  
x

x
play  
x

x
with  
x

x
fire  
x

x
get  
x

x
punished.”  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
them  
x

x
angry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
show  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
—  
x

x
though  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
he  
x

x
was,  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
was. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
no  
x

x
notice,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
singing. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bum,  
x

x
bum  
x

x
tree  
x

x
and  
x

x
fern!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Shrivel  
x

x
and  
x

x
scorch!  
x

x
A  
x

x
fizzling  
x

x
torch  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
light  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
for  
x

x
our  
x

x
delight,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Ya  
x

x
hey!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bake  
x

x
and  
x

x
toast  
x

x
’em,  
x

x
fry  
x

x
and  
x

x
roast  
x

x
’em!  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
beards  
x

x
blaze,  
x

x
and  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
glaze;  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
hair  
x

x
smells  
x

x
and  
x

x
skins  
x

x
crack,  
x

x
  
x

x
fat  
x

x
melts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bones  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
cinders  
x

lie

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
shall  
x

x
die,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
light  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
for  
x

our

delight,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Ya

hey!

x
  
x

x
Ya-harri-hey!  
x

x

x
  
x

x
Ya  
x

x
hoy!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
Ya  
x

x
hoy\  
x

x
the  
x

x
flames  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
s  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
it  
x

x
spread  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
The  
x

x
bark  
x

x
caught  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
branches  
x

x
cracked. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
splendour  
x

x
flashed  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
wand  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
lightning,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
spring  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
on  
x

x
high  
x

x
right  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
spears  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
That  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
probably  
x

x
have  
x

x
killed  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
hurtling  
x

x
down  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
thunderbolt. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
never  
x

x
leaped. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
  
x

x
swept  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
above,  
x

x
seized  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
talons,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
howl  
x

x
of  
x

x
anger  
x

x
and  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
Loud  
x

x
cried  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles,  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
whom  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
now  
x

x
spoken. 
x

x
Back  
x

x
swept  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
birds  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
with  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
like  
x

x
huge  
x

x
black  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
yammered  
x

x
and  
x

x
gnashed  
x

x
their  
x

x
teeth;  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
yelled  
x

x
and  
x

x
stamped  
x

x
with  
x

x
rage,  
x

x
and  
x

x
flung  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
spears  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain. 
x

x
Over  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles;  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
rush  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
beating  
x

x
wings  
x

x
smote  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
or  
x

x
drove  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
far  
x

x
away;  
x

x
their  
x

x
talons  
x

x
tore  
x

x
at  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
faces. 
x

x
  
x

x
Other  
x

x
birds  
x

x
flew  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree-tops  
x

x
and  
x

x
seized  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
scrambling  
x

x
up  
x

x
now  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
ever  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
go. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
left  
x

x
behind  
x

x
  
x

x
again!  
x

x
He  
x

x
just  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
catch  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dori’s  
x

x
  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
was  
x

x
borne  
x

x
off  
x

x
last  
x

x
of  
x

x
all;  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
together  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
tumult  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
burning,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
swinging  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
breaking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
far  
x

x
below  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
scattering  
x

x
far  
x

x
and  
x

x
wide  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods. 
x

x
A  
x

x
  
x

x
few  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
circling  
x

x
and  
x

x
sweeping  
x

x
  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
battleground. 
x

x
The  
x

x
flames  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
up  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
highest  
x

x
  
x

x
branches. 
x

x
They  
x

x
went  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
crackling  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
There  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
flurry  
x

x
of  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
and  
x

x
smoke. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
burning  
x

x
was  
x

x
faint  
x

x
  
x

x
below,  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
twinkle  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
black  
x

x
floor;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
high  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky,  
x

x
rising  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
strong  
x

x
sweeping  
x

x
circles. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
never  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
flight,  
x

x
clinging  
x

x
onto  
x

x
Dori’s  
x

x
ankles. 
x

x
He  
x

x
moaned  
x

x
  
x

x
“my  
x

x
arms,  
x

x
my  
x

x
arms!”;  
x

x
but  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
groaned  
x

x
“my  
x

x
  
x

x
poor  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
my  
x

x
poor  
x

x
legs!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
of  
x

x
times  
x

x
heights  
x

x
made  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
giddy. 
x

x
He  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn  
x

x
queer  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
cliff;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
liked  
x

x
ladders,  
x

x
let  
x

x
alone  
x

x
trees  
x

x
(never  
x

x
having  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
before). 
x

x
So  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
imagine  
x

x
how  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
swam  
x

x
now,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
down  
x

x
between  
x

x
his  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
toes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
lands  
x

x
opening  
x

x
wide  
x

x
underneath  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
touched  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
moon  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
hill-side  
x

x
rock  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
stream  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
plains. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
pale  
x

x
peaks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
nearer,  
x

x
moonlit  
x

x
spikes  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
black  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
Summer  
x

x
or  
x

x
not,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
very  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
He  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
hold  
x

x
on  
x

x
any  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
imagined  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
happen  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
felt  
x

x
sick. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
flight  
x

x
ended  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
him,  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms  
x

x
gave  
x

x
way. 
x

x
He  
x

x
loosed  
x

x
Dori’s  
x

x
  
x

x
ankles  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
gasp  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
onto  
x

x
the  
x

x
rough  
x

x
  
x

x
platform  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
eagle’s  
x

x
eyrie. 
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
speaking,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
mixture  
x

x
of  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
saved  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fear  
x

x
lest  
x

x
he  
x

x
fall  
x

x
off  
x

x
that  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
place  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
deep  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
side. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
queer  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
by  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
three  
x

x
days  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
next  
x

x
to  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
  
x

x
saying  
x

x
aloud:  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
a  
x

x
piece  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
feels  
x

x
like  
x

x
when  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
picked  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
pan  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
fork  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
back  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
shelf!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
answering,  
x

x
  
x

x
“because  
x

x
the  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
knows  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
pan  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
or  
x

x
later;  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
hoped  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
shan’t. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
aren’t  
x

x
forks!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
no!  
x

x
Not  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
like  
x

x
storks  
x

x
—  
x

x
forks,  
x

x
I  
x

x
mean,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
looking  
x

x
anxiously  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagle  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
perched  
x

x
close  
x

x
by. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
what  
x

x
other  
x

x
nonsense  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
saying,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagle  
x

x
would  
x

x
think  
x

x
it  
x

x
rude. 
x

x
You  
x

x
  
x

x
ought  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
rude  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
eagle,  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
size  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyrie  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
night!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
eagle  
x

x
only  
x

x
sharpened  
x

x
his  
x

x
beak  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stone  
x

x
and  
x

x
trimmed  
x

x
his  
x

x
feathers  
x

x
and  
x

x
took  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
notice. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
another  
x

x
eagle  
x

x
flew  
x

x
up. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
bids  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
your  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Shelf,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
off  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
other  
x

x
seized  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
claws  
x

x
and  
x

x
flew  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
alone. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
strength  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
what  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
messenger  
x

x
had  
x

x
meant  
x

x
by  
x

x
‘prisoners,’  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
begin  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
being  
x

x
torn  
x

x
up  
x

x
for  
x

x
supper  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rabbit,  
x

x
when  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
turn  
x

x
came. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
eagle  
x

x
came  
x

x
back,  
x

x
seized  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
talons  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
coat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
flew  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
way. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
laid  
x

x
down,  
x

x
trembling  
x

x
with  
x

x
fear,  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
wide  
x

x
shelf  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-side. 
x

x
There  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
path  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
it  
x

x
save  
x

x
by  
x

x
flying;  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
path  
x

x
down  
x

x
off  
x

x
it  
x

x
except  
x

x
by  
x

x
jumping  
x

x
over  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
precipice. 
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain

wall. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
also  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
after  
x

x
all. 
x

x
The  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagle-lord  
x

x
  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
one  
x

x
another  
x

x
slightly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
on  
x

x
friendly  
x

x
terms. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
often  
x

x
been  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
once  
x

x
rendered  
x

x
a  
x

x
service  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
healed  
x

x
their  
x

x
lord  
x

x
from  
x

x
an  
x

x
arrow-wound. 
x

x
So  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
‘prisoners’  
x

x
had  
x

x
meant  
x

x
‘prisoners  
x

x
rescued  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins’  
x

x
only,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
captives  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
eagles. 
x

x
As  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
listened  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
talk  
x

x
of  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
realized  
x

x
that  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
escape  
x

x
really  
x

x
and  
x

x
truly  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
discussing  
x

x
plans  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Eagle  
x

x
for  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
setting  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
well  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
plains  
x

x
  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
looking  
x

x
West  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Eyrie  
x

x
towards  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
take  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
near  
x

x
where  
x

x
men  
x

x
lived. 
x

x
“They  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
shoot  
x

x
at  
x

x
us  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
great  
x

x
bows  
x

x
of  
x

x
yew,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“for  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
think  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
after  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
sheep. 
x

x
And  
x

x
at  
x

x
other  
x

x
times  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
right. 
x

x
  
x

x
No!  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
cheat  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
sport,  
x

x
and  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
repay  
x

x
our  
x

x
thanks  
x

x
to  
x

x
you,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
risk  
x

x
ourselves  
x

x
for  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
southward  
x

x
plains.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“Take  
x

x
us  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
will!  
x

x
We  
x

x
are  
x

x
already  
x

x
deeply  
x

x
  
x

x
obliged  
x

x
to  
x

x
you. 
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
meantime  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
famished  
x

x
with  
x

x
hunger.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
dead  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
weak  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
voice  
x

x
that  
x

x
nobody  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
can  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
be  
x

x
mended,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Later  
x

x
on  
x

x
you  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
seen  
x

x
a  
x

x
bright  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
shelf  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
figures  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
round  
x

x
it  
x

x
cooking  
x

x
and  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
  
x

x
roasting  
x

x
smell. 
x

x
The  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
up  
x

x
dry  
x

x
  
x

x
boughs  
x

x
for  
x

x
fuel,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
rabbits,  
x

x
  
x

x
hares,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
sheep. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
managed  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
preparations. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
weak  
x

x
to  
x

x
help,  
x

x
and  
x

x
anyway  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
at  
x

x
skinning  
x

x
rabbits  
x

x
or  
x

x
cutting  
x

x
up  
x

x
meat,  
x

x
  
x

x
being  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
having  
x

x
it  
x

x
delivered  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
butcher  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
cook. 
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
was  
x

x
lying  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
doing  
x

x
his  
x

x
part  
x

x
in  
x

x
setting  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
going,  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
their  
x

x
tinder-boxes. 
x

x
  
x

x
(Dwarves  
x

x
have  
x

x
never  
x

x
taken  
x

x
to  
x

x
matches  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
yet.)  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
ended  
x

x
the  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountains. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
stomach  
x

x
was  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
full  
x

x
and  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
contentedly,  
x

x
though  
x

x
really  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
liked  
x

x
a  
x

x
loaf  
x

x
and  
x

x
butter  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
bits  
x

x
of  
x

x
meat  
x

x
  
x

x
toasted  
x

x
on  
x

x
sticks. 
x

x
He  
x

x
slept  
x

x
curled  
x

x
up  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hard  
x

x
rock  
x

x
more  
x

x
soundly  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
done  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
feather-bed  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
little  
x

x
hole  
x

x
at  
x

x
home. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
all  
x

x
night  
x

x
he  
x

x
dreamed  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
house  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
into  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
rooms  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
something  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
find  
x

x
nor  
x

x
remember  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like.

x

x
QUEER  
x

x
LODGINGS  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
early  
x

x
  
x

x
sun  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
He  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
kettle  
x

x
on  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
home  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wished  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
wash  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
brush. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
either,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
tea  
x

x
nor  
x

x
toast  
x

x
nor  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
breakfast,  
x

x
only  
x

x
cold  
x

x
mutton  
x

x
and  
x

x
rabbit. 
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
ready  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
fresh  
x

x
start. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
allowed  
x

x
to  
x

x
climb  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
eagle’s  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
cling  
x

x
between  
x

x
his  
x

x
wings. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
air  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
over  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
crying  
x

x
farewells  
x

x
and  
x

x
promising  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
repay  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
if  
x

x
ever  
x

x
they  
x

x
could,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
off  
x

x
rose  
x

x
fifteen  
x

x
great  
x

x
birds  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain’s  
x

x
side. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
things. 
x

x
The  
x

x
morning  
x

x
was  
x

x
cool,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
mists  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valleys  
x

x
and  
x

x
hollows  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
twined  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
peaks  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pinnacles  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
opened  
x

x
an  
x

x
eye  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
peep  
x

x
and  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
birds  
x

x
were  
x

x
already  
x

x
high  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
was  
x

x
far  
x

x
away,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
were  
x

x
falling  
x

x
back  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance. 
x

x
He  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
held  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
tighter. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
pinch!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
his  
x

x
eagle. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
need  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
look  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
like  
x

x
one. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
morning  
x

x
with  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
wind. 
x

x
What  
x

x
is  
x

x
finer  
x

x
than  
x

x
flying?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
say:  
x

x
“A  
x

x
warm  
x

x
bath  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
late  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
lawn  
x

x
afterwards;”  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
better  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
let  
x

x
go  
x

x
his  
x

x
clutch  
x

x
just  
x

x
a  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
bit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
seen  
x

x
the  
x

x
point  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
making  
x

x
for,  
x

x
even  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
great  
x

x
height,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
circling  
x

x
round  
x

x
in  
x

x
great  
x

x
spirals. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
this  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
while,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
opened  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
again. 
x

x
The  
x

x
earth  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
nearer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
below  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
trees  
x

x
that  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like  
x

x
oaks  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
elms,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wide  
x

x
grass  
x

x
lands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
  
x

x
running  
x

x
through  
x

x
it  
x

x
all. 
x

x
But  
x

x
cropping  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
looped  
x

x
itself  
x

x
about  
x

x
it,  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
rock,  
x

x
almost  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
hill  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
last  
x

x
outpost  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
distant  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
huge  
x

x
piece  
x

x
cast  
x

x
miles  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
plain  
x

x
by  
x

x
some  
x

x
giant  
x

x
among  
x

x
giants. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Quickly  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
rock  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
down  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
passengers. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
“wherever  
x

x
you  
x

x
fare,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
your  
x

x
eyries  
x

x
receive  
x

x
you  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
journey’s  
x

x
end!”  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
polite  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
among  
x

x
eagles. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“May  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
under  
x

x
your  
x

x
wings  
x

x
bear  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
sails  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
walks,”  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
knew  
x

x
the  
x

x
correct  
x

x
reply. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
parted. 
x

x
And  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
became  
x

x
in  
x

x
after  
x

x
days  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
of  
x

x
All  
x

x
  
x

x
Birds  
x

x
and  
x

x
wore  
x

x
a  
x

x
golden  
x

x
crown,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
fifteen  
x

x
  
x

x
chieftains  
x

x
golden  
x

x
collars  
x

x
(made  
x

of  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
gave  
x

x
them),  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
never  
x

x
saw  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
high  
x

x
and  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Five  
x

x
Armies. 
x

x
But  
x

x
as  
x

x
that  
x

x
comes  
x

x
in  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
tale  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
say  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
it  
x

x
just  
x

x
now. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
flat  
x

x
space  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
well  
x

x
worn  
x

x
path  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
steps  
x

x
  
x

x
leading  
x

x
down  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
across  
x

x
which  
x

x
a  
x

x
ford  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
huge  
x

x
flat  
x

x
stones  
x

x
led  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass-land  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
cave  
x

x
(a  
x

x
  
x

x
wholesome  
x

x
one  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
pebbly  
x

x
floor)  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
foot  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
steps  
x

x
and  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stony  
x

x
ford. 
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
the  
x

x
party  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
and  
x

x
discussed  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
always  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
you  
x

x
all  
x

x
safe  
x

x
(if  
x

x
  
x

x
possible)  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
now  
x

x
by  
x

x
good  
x

x
management  
x

x
and  
x

x
good  
x

x
luck  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
now  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
  
x

x
further  
x

x
east  
x

x
than  
x

x
I  
x

ever

meant

to

with

you,

for  
x

after  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
my  
x

x
adventure. 
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
look  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
on  
x

x
it  
x

x
again  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

all  
x

x
over,  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
some

other

pressing  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x

business

to  
x

x
attend  
x

x
to.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
groaned  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
distressed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
wept. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
always  
x

x
be  
x

x
there  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
them  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
difficulties. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
not  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
disappear  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
instant,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
can  
x

x
give  
x

x
you  
x

x
a  
x

x
day  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
more. 
x

x
Probably  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
help  
x

x
you  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x

x
present

plight,  
x

and  
x

x
I

need  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

help

x
myself. 
x

x
  
x

x
We

have

no

food,

and  
x

no

no

you

Now

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
that. 
x

x
You  
x

x
are  
x

x
still  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
miles  
x

x
north  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
which  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
following,  
x

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
pass  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hurry. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
few  
x

x
people  
x

x
live  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
parts,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
here  
x

x
since  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
down  
x

x
this  
x

x
way,  
x

x
which  
x

x
is  
x

x
some  
x

x
years  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
somebody  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
know  
x

x
of,  
x

x
who  
x

x
lives  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
away. 
x

x
That  
x

x
Somebody  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
steps  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
rock  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
I  
x

x
believe  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
calls  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
here  
x

x
often,  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
daytime,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
very  
x

x
dangerous. 
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
all  
x

x
goes  
x

x
well  
x

x
at  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
meeting,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
off  
x

x
and  
x

x
wish  
x

x
you  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
‘farewell  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
you  
x

x
fare!  
x

x
'  
x

x
”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
begged  
x

x
him  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
leave  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
offered  
x

x
him  
x

x
dragon-gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
change  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
shall  
x

x
  
x

x
see,  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
see!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
earned  
x

x
already  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
dragon-gold  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
pleading. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
their  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
and  
x

x
bathed  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
and  
x

x
clear  
x

x
and  
x

x
stony  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
ford. 
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
dried  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
strong  
x

x
and  
x

x
warm,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
refreshed,  
x

x
if  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
sore  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
hungry. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ford  
x

x
(carrying  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit),  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
march  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
green  
x

x
grass  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lines  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide-armed  
x

x
oaks  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
tall  
x

x
  
x

x
elms. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
why  
x

x
is  
x

x
it  
x

x
called  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
along  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard’s  
x

x
side. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He  
x

x
called  
x

x
it  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock,  
x

x
because  
x

x
carrock  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
his  
x

x
word  
x

x
for  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
calls  
x

x
things  
x

x
like  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
carrocks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
one  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
because  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
one  
x

x
near  
x

x
his  
x

x
home  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
knows  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
well.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
calls  
x

x
it?  
x

x
Who  
x

x
knows  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
Somebody  
x

x
I  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
of  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
person. 
x

x
You  
x

x
must  
x

x
all  
x

x
be  
x

x
very  
x

x
polite  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
introduce  
x

x
you. 
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
introduce  
x

x
you  
x

x
slowly,  
x

x
two  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
two,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think;  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
careful  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
annoy  
x

x
him,  
x

x
or  
x

x
heaven  
x

x
knows  
x

x
what  
x

x
will  
x

x
happen. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
appalling  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
angry,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
kind  
x

x
enough  
x

x
if  
x

x
humoured. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
I  
x

x
warn  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
gets  
x

x
angry  
x

x
easily.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
all  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
round  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
talking  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Is  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
person  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
taking  
x

x
us  
x

x
to  
x

x
now?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
“Couldn’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
find  
x

x
someone  
x

x
more  
x

x
easy-  
x

x
  
x

x
tempered?  
x

x
Hadn't  
x

x
you  
x

x
better  
x

x
explain  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
  
x

x
clearer?”  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes  
x

x
it  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
is!  
x

x
No  
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
not!  
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
explaining  
x

x
very  
x

x
carefully”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
  
x

x
crossly. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
know  
x

x
more,  
x

x
his  
x

x
name  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
He  
x

x
is  
x

x
very  
x

x
strong,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
skin-  
x

x
  
x

x
changer.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What!  
x

x
a  
x

x
furrier,  
x

x
a  
x

x
man  
x

x
that  
x

calls

rabbits

conies,

their

skins

into

Bilbo.

“Good

gracious

heavens,

no,

x
no,

x
NO,

NO!”  
x

x

said

Gandalf.

“Don’t

don’t

mention

the

word

again

within

a

hundred

his

such

unfortunate

x
word!  
x

x
He

is  
x

x
a  
x

x
skin-changer. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
changes  
x

x
his  
x

x
skin:  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
he  
x

is

a

x
huge  
x

x
  
x

x
black

bear,

x
sometimes

he

a

great

black-haired

beard. 
x

I

cannot

tell

you

much

more,

though

that

ought

to

be

enough.

Some

say

that

he

a

descended

the

there

the

Others

out

of

the

North. 
x

I

cannot

say,

though

I

fancy

the

last

is

the

true

tale.

He

the

to

ask

of.

“At

he

under

no

but  
x

x

his

own. 
x

x
He  
x

x
lives  
x

x
in  
x

x
an  
x

x
oak-wood  
x

x
and  
x

x
has

a  
x

great

wooden

house;

and

as

a

man

he

keeps

cattle

horses

which

are

nearly

as

marvellous

as

himself. 
x

x
They

work  
x

for  
x

him  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
talk

to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
does

not

eat  
x

x
them;  
x

x
neither

does

he

hunt

or

eat

wild

animals. 
x

x
He

keeps

hives  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hives  
x

x
of  
x

x
great  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
bees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
lives

most  
x

x
on  
x

x

cream

and

honey. 
x

x
As

x
a

bear  
x

x
he

ranges  
x

x
far  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wide. 
x

x
I  
x

x
once  
x

saw  
x

x
him  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
at  
x

x
night  
x

x
watching  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
  
x

x
sinking  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
him  
x

x
growl  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tongue  
x

x
of  
x

x
bears:  
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
will  
x

x
come  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
perish  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
back!’  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why  
x

x
I  
x

x
believe  
x

x
he  
x

x
once  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
himself.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
now  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
asked  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
questions. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
still  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
walk  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
  
x

x
slope  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
dale  
x

x
they  
x

x
plodded. 
x

x
It  
x

x
grew  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
hot. 
x

x
Sometimes  
x

x
they  
x

x
rested  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
so  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
acorns,  
x

x
if  
x

x
any  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
ripe  
x

x
enough  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
great  
x

x
patches  
x

x
of  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
spring  
x

x
up,  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
kinds  
x

x
growing  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
planted. 
x

x
Especially  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
clover,  
x

x
waving  
x

x
patches  
x

x
of  
x

x
cockscomb  
x

x
  
x

x
clover,  
x

x
and  
x

x
purple  
x

x
clover,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wide  
x

x
stretches  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
short  
x

x
white  
x

x
sweet  
x

x
honey-smelling  
x

x
clover. 
x

x
There  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
buzzing  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
whirring  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
droning  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
Bees  
x

x
were  
x

x
busy  
x

x
everywhere. 
x

x
And  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
bees!  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
anything  
x

x
like  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“If  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
sting  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
“I  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
swell  
x

x
up  
x

x
as  
x

x
big  
x

x
again  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
am!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
than  
x

x
hornets. 
x

x
The  
x

x
drones  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
bigger  
x

x
than  
x

x
your  
x

x
thumb,  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bands  
x

x
of  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
deep  
x

x
black  
x

x
bodies  
x

x
  
x

x
shone  
x

x
like  
x

x
fiery  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
getting  
x

x
near,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
bee-pastures.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
belt  
x

x
of  
x

x
tall  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
oaks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
these  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
high  
x

x
thorn-  
x

x
  
x

x
hedge  
x

x
through  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
neither  
x

x
see  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
scramble. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
wait  
x

x
here,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves;  
x

x
“and  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
call  
x

x
or  
x

x
whistle  
x

x
begin  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
after  
x

x
me  
x

x
—  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
I  
x

x
go  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
only  
x

x
in  
x

x
pairs,  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
about  
x

x
five  
x

x
minutes  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
each  
x

x
pair  
x

x
of  
x

x
you. 
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
is  
x

x
fattest  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
do  
x

x
for  
x

x
two,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
come  
x

x
alone  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
last. 
x

x
Come  
x

x
on  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins!  
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
gate  
x

x
  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
round  
x

x
this  
x

x
way.”  
x

x
And  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
hedge  
x

x
taking  
x

x
the  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
soon  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
gate,  
x

x
high  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
broad,  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
gardens  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
cluster  
x

x
of  
x

x
low  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
buildings,  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
thatched  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
unshaped  
x

x
logs:  
x

x
  
x

x
barns,  
x

x
stables,  
x

x
sheds,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
low  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
  
x

x
house. 
x

x
Inside  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
southward  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
hedge  
x

x
were  
x

x
rows  
x

x
and  
x

x
rows  
x

x
of  
x

x
hives  
x

x
with  
x

x
bell-  
x

x
  
x

x
shaped  
x

x
tops  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
straw. 
x

x
The  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
giant  
x

x
bees  
x

x
flying  
x

x
to  
x

x
and  
x

x
fro  
x

x
and  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
filled  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
open  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
creaking  
x

x
gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
  
x

x
track  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
house. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
horses,  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
sleek  
x

x
and  
x

x
well-groomed,  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
up  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
grass  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
them  
x

x
intently  
x

x
with  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
intelligent  
x

x
faces;  
x

x
then  
x

x
off  
x

x
they  
x

x
galloped  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
buildings. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
him  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
arrival  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
strangers,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
reached  
x

x
a  
x

x
courtyard,  
x

x
three  
x

x
walls  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
were  
x

x
formed  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
house  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
its  
x

x
two  
x

x
long  
x

x
wings. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
lying  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
oak-trunk  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
lopped  
x

x
branches  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
beside  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Standing  
x

x
near  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
huge  
x

x
man  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
thick  
x

x
black  
x

x
beard  
x

x
and  
x

x
hair,  
x

x
and  
x

x
great  
x

x
bare  
x

x
arms  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
legs  
x

x
with  
x

x
knotted  
x

x
muscles. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
clothed  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
tunic  
x

x
of  
x

x
wool  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
knees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
leaning  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
axe. 
x

x
The  
x

x
horses  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
standing  
x

x
by  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
noses  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
shoulder. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ugh!  
x

x
here  
x

x
they  
x

x
are!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
horses. 
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
look  
x

x
dangerous. 
x

x
You  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
off!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
laugh,  
x

x
put  
x

x
down  
x

x
his  
x

x
axe  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
forward. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
want?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
gruffly,  
x

x
standing  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
towering  
x

x
tall  
x

x
above  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
easily  
x

x
have  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
through  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
ducking  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
to  
x

x
miss  
x

x
the  
x

x
fringe  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
man’s  
x

x
brown  
x

x
tunic. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
Gandalf,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
him,”  
x

x
growled  
x

x
the  
x

x
man. 
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
what’s  
x

x
this  
x

x
little  
x

x
fellow?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
stooping  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
frown  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
bushy  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
eyebrows. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
is  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
of  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
family  
x

x
and  
x

x
unimpeachable  
x

x
reputation,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
bowed. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
hat  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
painfully  
x

x
conscious  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
missing  
x

x
buttons. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
a  
x

x
wizard,”  
x

x
continued  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
you,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
me;  
x

x
but  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
cousin  
x

x
Radagast  
x

x
who  
x

x
lives  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Southern  
x

x
borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes;  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
as  
x

x
wizards  
x

x
go,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
believe. 
x

x
I  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
him  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
now  
x

x
I  
x

x
know  
x

x
who  
x

x
you  
x

x
are,  
x

x
or  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
say  
x

x
you  
x

x
are. 
x

x
What  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
want?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“To  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth,  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
lost  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
luggage  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
lost  
x

x
our  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
rather  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
need  
x

x
of  
x

x
help,  
x

x
or  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
of  
x

x
advice. 
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
say  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
rather  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
time  
x

x
with  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Goblins?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
big  
x

x
man  
x

x
less  
x

x
gruffly. 
x

x
“O  
x

x
  
x

x
ho,  
x

x
so  
x

x
you’ve  
x

x
been  
x

x
having  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
you?  
x

x
What  
x

x
did  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
near  
x

x
them  
x

x
for?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
mean  
x

x
to. 
x

x
They  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
us  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pass  
x

x
which  
x

x
we  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross;  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lands  
x

x
over  
x

x
West  
x

x
into  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
countries  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
tale.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Then  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
come  
x

x
inside  
x

x
and  
x

x
tell  
x

x
  
x

x
me  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
take  
x

x
all  
x

x
day,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
man  
x

x
leading  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
through  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
door  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
courtyard  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
house. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Following  
x

x
him  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
wide  
x

x
hall  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire-place  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle. 
x

x
Though  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
summer  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
wood-fire  
x

x
burning  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
was  
x

x
rising  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
blackened  
x

x
  
x

x
rafters  
x

x
in  
x

x
search  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
through  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
opening  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof. 
x

x
They  
x

x
passed  
x

x
through  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
dim  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
lit  
x

x
only  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hole  
x

x
above  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
through  
x

x
another  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
door  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
veranda  
x

x
propped  
x

x
on  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
posts  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
single  
x

x
tree-trunks. 
x

x
It  
x

x
faced  
x

x
south  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
warm  
x

x
and  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
westering  
x

x
sun  
x

x
which  
x

x
slanted  
x

x
into  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
golden  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
garden  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
steps.

x

x
foRo'smi  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
on  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
benches  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
began  
x

x
his  
x

x
tale,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
swung  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
legs  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
garden,  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
what  
x

x
their  
x

x
names  
x

x
could  
x

x
be,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
seen  
x

x
half  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
before. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
was  
x

x
coming  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
friend  
x

x
or  
x

x
two. 
x

x
. 
x

x
.”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Or  
x

x
two?  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
only  
x

x
see  
x

x
one,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
that,”

said  
x

x
Beorn.

“Well

tell

you

the

truth,

I

not

you

with  
x

a

lot

of

us,

x
until  
x

x
I

found  
x

x
out  
x

x
if  
x

you  
x

x

were

busy.

I

a

may.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Go  
x

x
on,  
x

x
call  
x

x
away!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
shrill  
x

x
whistle,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
presently  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
came  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
house  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
garden  
x

x
path  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
bowing  
x

x
low  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“One  
x

x
or  
x

x
three  
x

x
you  
x

x
meant,  
x

x
I  
x

x
see!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
these  
x

x
aren’t  
x

x
hobbits,  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
dwarves!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield,  
x

x
at  
x

x
your

service!  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
service!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
two  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
bowing  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
need  
x

x
your  
x

service,

thank  
x

you,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
“but

x
I

I

that

Gandalf,

We

“Go

telling,

Beorn,

who

was

never

very

polite.

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There

was

a

the

out

at

the

the

I

“Do

you

two

several?”

“Well,

no.

As

a

of

there

I

Shy,

I

expect.

x
You

see,

we

very

afraid

a

on,

again!

in

for  
x

a

party,

it

seems,

one

two

more

won’t

make

much

difference,”  
x

x
growled  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
whistled  
x

x
again;  
x

x
but  
x

x
Nori  
x

x
and  
x

x
Ori  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
there  
x

x
almost  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
for,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
remember,  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
pairs  
x

x
every  
x

x
five  
x

x
minutes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hullo!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
came  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
quick  
x

x
  
x

x
—

where  
x

were  
x

x
you  
x

x
hiding?  
x

x
Come

on

my

jack-in-

the-boxes!”

“Nori

Ori

at.

x

x
they

began;

but

Beorn

interrupted

them.

“Thank

you!

When

I

want

your

I

will

ask  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Sit  
x

x
down,

and  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
this  
x

x
tale,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
supper-time

before

it

is

ended.”  
x

“As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

we

were

asleep,”  
x

went  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
“a  
x

x
crack  
x

x
at  
x

the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave  
x

x
  
x

x
opened;  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
grabbed  
x

x
the

hobbit

x
the

dwarves

“Troop

of

What

were

you

—

a  
x

x

travelling

circus?

you

lots

of

goods?

Or

do

you

always

call  
x

x
six

a

troop?”  
x

x

“O

no!

As

a

matter

of

there

us

well,

here

two

more!”  
x

x
Just  
x

x
at

that  
x

x
  
x

x
moment  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bowed  
x

x
so  
x

x
low  
x

x
that

their

beards  
x

x
swept  
x

x
the

x
stone

x

x
floor. 
x

x
The  
x

x
big  
x

x
man  
x

was  
x

x
frowning  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
their  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
frightfully  
x

x
polite,  
x

x
and  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
nodding  
x

bending

and

x
bowing  
x

x
and  
x

x
waving  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
hoods  
x

x
before  
x

x
their  
x

x
knees  
x

x
(in  
x

x
proper  
x

x
dwarf-  
x

x
  
x

x
fashion),  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
frowning  
x

x
and  
x

x
burst  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
chuckling  
x

x
laugh:  
x

x
they  
x

x
looked  
x

x
so  
x

x
comical. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Troop,  
x

x
was  
x

x
right,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“A  
x

x
fine  
x

x
comic  
x

x
  
x

x
one.

in

my

men,

your

only

your

then

sit

down

wagging!”

x
  
x

“Balin

Dwalin,”  
x

they

said

not  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
offended,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
flop  
x

x
on  
x

x
the

x
floor  
x

x
looking  
x

x

rather

surprised.

x
  
x

“Now

on

again!”

Beorn

the  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
was  
x

x
I?  
x

x
O  
x

x
yes  
x

x
—  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
grabbed. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
killed  
x

x
a  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
flash  
x

x
—  
x

x
”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good!”  
x

x
growled  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
some  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
being  
x

x
a  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
then.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
closed. 
x

x
I  
x

x
followed  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
crowded  
x

x
with  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
with  
x

x
thirty  
x

x
or  
x

x
forty  
x

x
armed  
x

x
guards. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
to  
x

x
myself  
x

x
‘even  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
chained  
x

x
together,  
x

x
what  
x

x
can  
x

x
a  
x

x
dozen  
x

x
do  
x

x
against  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
many?’”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
dozen!  
x

x
That’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
I've  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
eight  
x

x
called  
x

x
a  
x

x
dozen. 
x

x
Or  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
still  
x

x
got  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
jacks  
x

x
that  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
yet  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
boxes?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
yes,  
x

x
there  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
couple  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
now  
x

x
—  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
I  
x

x
believe,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
these  
x

x
two  
x

x
now  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
smiling  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowing. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That’s  
x

x
enough!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
“Sit  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
quiet!  
x

x
Now  
x

x
go  
x

x
on,  
x

x
Gandalf!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
tale,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
fight  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
the  
x

x
discovery  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
horror  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
mislaid. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
counted  
x

x
ourselves  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
only  
x

x
fourteen  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
left!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Fourteen!  
x

x
That’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
I’ve  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
from  
x

x
ten  
x

x
leave  
x

x
fourteen. 
x

x
You  
x

x
mean  
x

x
nine,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
else  
x

x
you  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
told  
x

x
me  
x

x
yet  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
names  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
party.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
you  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
seen  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
And,  
x

x
bless  
x

x
me!  
x

x
here  
x

x
they  
x

x
are. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
forgive  
x

x
them  
x

x
for  
x

x
bothering  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
let  
x

x
’em  
x

x
all  
x

x
come!  
x

x
Hurry  
x

x
up!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
along,  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
two,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sit  
x

x
down!  
x

x
But  
x

x
look  
x

x
here,  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
now  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
only  
x

x
got  
x

x
yourself  
x

x
and  
x

x
ten  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
lost. 
x

x
That  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
makes  
x

x
eleven  
x

x
(plus  
x

x
one  
x

x
mislaid)  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
fourteen,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
wizards  
x

x
count  
x

x
differently  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
people. 
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
please  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tale.”  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
show  
x

x
it  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
help,  
x

x
but  
x

x
really  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
interested. 
x

x
You  
x

x
see,  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
days  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
known  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
describing. 
x

x
He  
x

x
nodded  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
growled,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
  
x

x
reappearance  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
scramble  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stone-slide  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolf-ring  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
all  
x

x
underneath,  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
strode  
x

x
about  
x

x
and  
x

x
muttered:  
x

x
“I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
there!  
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
given  
x

x
them  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
fireworks!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
very  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
tale  
x

x
was  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
impression,  
x

x
“I  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
I  
x

x
could. 
x

x
There  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
mad  
x

x
underneath  
x

x
us  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
blaze  
x

x
in  
x

x
places,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
and  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
us. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
yelled  
x

x
with  
x

x
delight  
x

x
and  
x

x
sang  
x

x
songs  
x

x
making  
x

x
  
x

x
fun  
x

x
of  
x

x
us. 
x

x
Fifteen  
x

x
birds  
x

x
in  
x

x
live  
x

x
fir-trees  
x

x
. 
x

x
. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
heavens!”  
x

x
growled  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
that  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
count. 
x

x
They  
x

x
can. 
x

x
  
x

x
Twelve  
x

x
isn't  
x

x
fifteen  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
know  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
so  
x

x
do  
x

x
I. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
well. 
x

x
I  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
ventured  
x

x
to  
x

x
introduce  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
before,  
x

x
but  
x

x
here  
x

x
they  
x

x
are.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
came  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
gasped  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
up  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
fat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
  
x

x
angry  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
left  
x

x
till  
x

x
last. 
x

x
He  
x

x
refused  
x

x
to  
x

x
wait  
x

x
  
x

x
five  
x

x
minutes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
followed  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
two. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
now  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
fifteen  
x

x
of  
x

x
you;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
can  
x

x
count,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
finish  
x

x
this  
x

x
story  
x

x
without  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
interruptions.”  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
saw  
x

x
then  
x

x
how  
x

x
clever  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
been. 
x

x
The  
x

x
interruptions  
x

x
had  
x

x
really  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
more  
x

x
interested  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
story,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
story  
x

x
had  
x

x
kept  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
sending  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
off  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
like  
x

x
suspicious  
x

x
beggars. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
never  
x

x
invited  
x

x
people  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
house,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
help  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
very  
x

x
few  
x

x
friends  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
lived  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
way  
x

x
away;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
never  
x

x
invited  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
couple  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
house  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
fifteen  
x

x
strangers  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
porch!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
By  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
had  
x

x
finished  
x

x
his  
x

x
tale  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
told  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
eagles’  
x

x
rescue  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
how  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
been  
x

x
brought  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sun  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
peaks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
were  
x

x
long  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
garden. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Avery  
x

x
good  
x

x
tale!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
best  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while. 
x

x
If  
x

x
all  
x

x
beggars  
x

x
could  
x

x
tell  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
one,  
x

x
they  
x

x
might  
x

x
find  
x

x
me  
x

x
kinder. 
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
making  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
up,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
but  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
deserve  
x

x
a  
x

x
supper  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
story  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same. 
x

x
  
x

x
Let’s  
x

x
have  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes  
x

x
please!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
said  
x

x
together. 
x

x
“Thank  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
very  
x

x
much!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
quite  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
  
x

x
clapped  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
four  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
white  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
several  
x

x
large  
x

x
long-bodied  
x

x
  
x

x
grey  
x

x
dogs. 
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
said  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
queer  
x

x
language  
x

x
like  
x

x
animal  
x

x
noises  
x

x
turned  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
talk. 
x

x
They  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
torches  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
mouths,  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
lit  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
in  
x

x
low  
x

x
brackets  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
central  
x

x
hearth. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dogs  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
stand  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
hind-legs  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
wished,  
x

x
and  
x

x
carry  
x

x
things  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
fore-feet. 
x

x
  
x

x
Quickly  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
out  
x

x
boards  
x

x
and  
x

x
trestles  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
walls  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
them  
x

x
up  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
baa  
x

x
—  
x

x
baa  
x

x
—  
x

x
baa!  
x

x
was  
x

x
heard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
some  
x

x
snow-white  
x

x
sheep  
x

x
led  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
  
x

x
coal-black  
x

x
ram. 
x

x
One  
x

x
bore  
x

x
a  
x

x
white  
x

x
cloth  
x

x
  
x

x
embroidered  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
edges  
x

x
with  
x

x
figures  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
animals;  
x

x
others  
x

x
bore  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
broad  
x

x
backs  
x

x
trays  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
bowls  
x

x
and  
x

x
platters  
x

x
and  
x

x
knives  
x

x
and  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
  
x

x
spoons,  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
dogs  
x

x
took  
x

x
and  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
laid  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trestle-tables. 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
very  
x

x
low,  
x

x
low  
x

x
  
x

x
enough  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
at  
x

x
comfortably. 
x

x
  
x

x
Beside  
x

x
them  
x

x
a  
x

x
pony  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
two  
x

x
low-seated  
x

x
  
x

x
benches  
x

x
with  
x

x
wide  
x

x
rush-bottoms  
x

x
and  
x

x
little  
x

x
short  
x

x
  
x

x
thick  
x

x
legs  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
while  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
end  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
big  
x

x
black  
x

x
chair  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
sort  
x

x
(in  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
great  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
far  
x

x
out  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
table). 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
chairs  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
probably  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
low  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
tables  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
convenience  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wonderful  
x

x
animals  
x

x
that  
x

x
waited  
x

x
on  
x

x
him. 
x

x
What  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on?  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
forgotten. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
round  
x

x
drum-  
x

x
  
x

x
shaped  
x

x
sections  
x

x
of  
x

x
logs,  
x

x
smoothed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
polished,  
x

x
and  
x

x
low  
x

x
enough  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo;  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
seated  
x

x
at  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
table,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
seen  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
gathering  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
year. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
dinner,  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
had  
x

x
since  
x

x
they  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
House  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
West  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
good-bye  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
Elrond. 
x

x
The  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
torches  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
flickered  
x

x
about  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
table  
x

x
were  
x

x
two  
x

x
  
x

x
tall  
x

x
red  
x

x
beeswax  
x

x
candles. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
ate,  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
deep  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
voice  
x

x
told  
x

x
tales  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wild  
x

x
lands  
x

x
on  
x

x
this  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
outstretched  
x

x
far  
x

x
to  
x

x
North  
x

x
and  
x

x
South  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
day’s  
x

x
ride  
x

x
before  
x

x
them,  
x

x
barring  
x

x
their  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
East,  
x

x
the  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
forest  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
listened  
x

x
and  
x

x
shook  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
beards,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
must  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
venture  
x

x
into  
x

x
that  
x

x
forest  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
worst  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
perils  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
pass  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
  
x

x
stronghold. 
x

x
When  
x

x
dinner  
x

x
was  
x

x
over  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
tales  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
own,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
growing  
x

x
drowsy  
x

x
and  
x

x
paid  
x

x
little  
x

x
heed  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
making  
x

x
of  
x

x
things  
x

x
by  
x

x
smith-craft,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
appear  
x

x
to  
x

x
care  
x

x
for  
x

x
such  
x

x
things:  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
things  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
or  
x

x
silver  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
few  
x

x
save  
x

x
the  
x

x
knives  
x

x
were  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
metal  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
sat  
x

x
long  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
table  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
  
x

x
drinking-bowls  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
mead. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dark  
x

x
night  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
outside. 
x

x
The  
x

x
fires  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hall  
x

x
were  
x

x
built  
x

x
with  
x

x
fresh  
x

x
logs  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
torches  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
put  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
flames  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
  
x

x
standing  
x

x
tall  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
trees  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
Whether  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
magic  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
not,  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
a  
x

x
sound  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
wind  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
stirring  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rafters,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hoot  
x

x
of  
x

x
owls. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
nod  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
voices  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
grow  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
away,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
start. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
great  
x

x
door  
x

x
had  
x

x
creaked  
x

x
and  
x

x
slammed. 
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
  
x

x
cross-legged  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
presently  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
verses  
x

x
were  
x

x
like  
x

x
this,  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
more,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
singing  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
wind  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
withered  
x

x
heath,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
no  
x

x
leaf:  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
lay  
x

x
by  
x

x
night  
x

x
and  
x

x
day,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark  
x

x
things  
x

x
silent  
x

x
crept  
x

x
beneath. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
wind  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
tide  
x

x
it  
x

x
roared  
x

x
and  
x

x
rolled;  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
groaned,  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
moaned,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
were  
x

x
laid  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
mould. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
wind  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
from  
x

x
West  
x

x
to  
x

x
East;  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
movement  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
ceased,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
shrill  
x

x
and  
x

x
harsh  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
marsh  
x

x
  
x

x
its  
x

x
whistling  
x

x
voices  
x

x
were  
x

x
released. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
grasses  
x

x
hissed,  
x

x
their  
x

x
tassels  
x

x
bent,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
reeds  
x

x
were  
x

x
rattling  
x

x
—  
x

x
on  
x

x
it  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
o’er  
x

x
shaken  
x

x
pool  
x

x
under  
x

x
heavens  
x

x
cool  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
racing  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
were  
x

x
tom  
x

x
and  
x

x
rent. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
passed  
x

x
the  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
bare  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
swept  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
lair:  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
black  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark  
x

x
lay  
x

x
boulders  
x

x
stark  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
flying  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
and  
x

x
took  
x

x
its  
x

x
flight  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide  
x

x
seas  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
night. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
moon  
x

x
set  
x

x
sail  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
gale,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
stars  
x

x
were  
x

x
fanned  
x

x
to  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
light. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
nod  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
stood  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
us  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep,’’  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
us,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
for  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
hall  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
rest  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
and  
x

x
safe,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
warn  
x

x
you  
x

x
all  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
forget  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
said  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
left  
x

x
us:  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
stray  
x

x
outside  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
is  
x

x
up,  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
peril.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
beds  
x

x
had  
x

x
already  
x

x
been  
x

x
laid  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
raised  
x

x
  
x

x
platform  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
outer  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
him  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
mattress  
x

x
of  
x

x
straw  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
woollen  
x

x
blankets. 
x

x
He  
x

x
snuggled  
x

x
into  
x

x
them  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
gladly,  
x

x
summertime  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was. 
x

x
The  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
burned  
x

x
low  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
asleep. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke:  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
had  
x

x
now  
x

x
sunk  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
embers;  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
to  
x

x
judge  
x

x
by  
x

x
their  
x

x
breathing;  
x

x
a  
x

x
splash  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
white  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
high  
x

x
moon,  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
peering  
x

x
down  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
smoke-  
x

x
  
x

x
hole  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
growling  
x

x
sound  
x

x
outside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
as  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
great  
x

x
animal  
x

x
scuffling  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
in  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
shape,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
bear  
x

x
and  
x

x
kill  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
dived  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
blankets  
x

x
and  
x

x
hid  
x

x
his  
x

x
head,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fell  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
again  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
fears. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
full  
x

x
morning  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
awoke. 
x

x
One  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
over  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
down  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bump  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
platform  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
about  
x

x
it,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Get  
x

x
up  
x

x
lazybones,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“or  
x

x
there  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
left  
x

x
for  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Up  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Breakfast!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
breakfast?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Mostly  
x

x
inside  
x

x
us,”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
moving  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
left  
x

x
is  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
veranda. 
x

x
We  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
ever  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
up;  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
anywhere,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
found  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
laid  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
we  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
out.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
Gandalf?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
moving  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O!  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
about  
x

x
somewhere,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
evening. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
before  
x

x
sunset  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
walked  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
having  
x

x
supper,  
x

x
waited  
x

x
on  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
wonderful  
x

x
animals,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
day. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
and  
x

x
heard  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
puzzled. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
our  
x

x
host,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
all  
x

x
day  
x

x
yourself?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“One  
x

x
question  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
time  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
none  
x

x
till  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
supper!  
x

x
I  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
bite  
x

x
since  
x

x
breakfast.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
away  
x

x
his  
x

x
plate  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
jug  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
two  
x

x
whole  
x

x
loaves  
x

x
(with  
x

x
  
x

x
masses  
x

x
of  
x

x
butter  
x

x
and  
x

x
honey  
x

x
and  
x

x
clotted  
x

x
cream)  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
drunk  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
a  
x

x
quart  
x

x
of  
x

x
mead  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
pipe. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
answer  
x

x
the  
x

x
second  
x

x
  
x

x
question  
x

x
first,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
bless  
x

x
me!  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
splendid  
x

x
place  
x

x
for  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
rings!”  
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
more  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
busy  
x

x
sending  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
rings  
x

x
  
x

x
dodging  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
changing  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
into  
x

x
all  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
of  
x

x
different  
x

x
shapes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
colours,  
x

x
and  
x

x
setting  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
chasing  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hole  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof. 
x

x
They  
x

x
must  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
looked  
x

x
very  
x

x
queer  
x

x
from  
x

x
outside,  
x

x
popping  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
one  
x

x
after  
x

x
another,  
x

x
green,  
x

x
blue,  
x

x
  
x

x
red,  
x

x
silver-grey,  
x

x
yellow,  
x

x
white;  
x

x
big  
x

x
ones,  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
ones;  
x

x
little  
x

x
ones  
x

x
dodging  
x

x
through  
x

x
big  
x

x
ones  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
joining  
x

x
into  
x

x
figure-eights,  
x

x
and  
x

x
going  
x

x
off  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
flock  
x

x
of  
x

x
birds  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
picking  
x

x
out  
x

x
bear-tracks,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
at  
x

x
last. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
regular  
x

x
  
x

x
bears’  
x

x
meeting  
x

x
outside  
x

x
here  
x

x
last  
x

x
night. 
x

x
I  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
made  
x

x
them  
x

x
all:  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
far  
x

x
too  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
various  
x

x
sizes  
x

x
too. 
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
say  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
bears,  
x

x
large  
x

x
bears,  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
bears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
gigantic  
x

x
big  
x

x
bears,  
x

x
all  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
outside  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
to  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
dawn. 
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
almost  
x

x
  
x

x
every  
x

x
direction,  
x

x
except  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
west  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
river,  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountains. 
x

x
In  
x

x
that  
x

x
direction  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
set  
x

x
of  
x

x
footprints  
x

x
led  
x

x
—  
x

x
none  
x

x
coming,  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
ones  
x

x
going  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
here. 
x

x
I  
x

x
followed  
x

x
these  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
disappeared  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock  
x

x
for  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
easy  
x

x
  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
remember,  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
from  
x

x
this  
x

x
bank  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
ford,  
x

x
but  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
standing  
x

x
up  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
swirling  
x

x
channel. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
walk  
x

x
miles  
x

x
before  
x

x
I  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
was  
x

x
wide  
x

x
and  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
enough  
x

x
for  
x

x
me  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
wade  
x

x
and  
x

x
swim,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
miles  
x

x
back  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
pick  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
tracks  
x

x
again. 
x

x
By  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
too  
x

x
late  
x

x
for  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
follow  
x

x
them  
x

x
far. 
x

x
They  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
straight  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
pine-woods  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
east  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains,  
x

x
where  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
our  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
little  
x

x
party  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
before  
x

x
last. 
x

x
And  
x

x
now  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
your  
x

x
first  
x

x
question,  
x

x
too,”  
x

x
ended  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
silent. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
what  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
  
x

x
meant. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
“if  
x

x
he  
x

x
leads  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
down  
x

x
here?  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
all  
x

x
be  
x

x
caught  
x

x
and  
x

x
killed!  
x

x
I  
x

x
thought  
x

x
you  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
friend  
x

x
of  
x

x
theirs.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“So  
x

x
I  
x

x
did. 
x

x
And  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
silly!  
x

x
You  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
to  
x

x
bed,  
x

x
your  
x

x
wits  
x

x
are  
x

x
sleepy.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
felt  
x

x
quite  
x

x
crushed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
else  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
go  
x

x
to  
x

x
bed;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
singing  
x

x
songs  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
still  
x

x
puzzling  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
dreamed  
x

x
a  
x

x
dream  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
black  
x

x
bears  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
slow  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
  
x

x
dances  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
moonlight  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
courtyard. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
when  
x

x
everyone  
x

x
  
x

x
else  
x

x
was  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
  
x

x
scraping,  
x

x
scuffling,  
x

x
snuffling,  
x

x
and  
x

x
growling  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
before. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
wakened  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
“So  
x

x
here  
x

x
you  
x

x
all  
x

x
are  
x

x
still!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
He  
x

x
picked  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughed:  
x

x
“Not  
x

x
  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
up  
x

x
by  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
or  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
or  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
bears  
x

x
  
x

x
yet  
x

x
I  
x

x
see”;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
poked  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
waistcoat  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
disrespectfully. 
x

x
“Little  
x

x
bunny  
x

x
is  
x

x
getting  
x

x
nice  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fat  
x

x
again  
x

x
on  
x

x
bread  
x

x
and  
x

x
honey,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
chuckled. 
x

x
“Come  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
some  
x

x
more!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
jolly  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
change;  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
splendidly  
x

x
good  
x

x
humour  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
set  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
funny  
x

x
stories;  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
long  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
or  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
nice  
x

x
to  
x

x
them,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
back  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
—  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
guess  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
travel  
x

x
quickly,  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
bear’s  
x

x
shape  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate. 
x

x
From  
x

x
the  
x

x
burnt  
x

x
wolf-  
x

x
  
x

x
glade  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
soon  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
that  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
story  
x

x
was  
x

x
true;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
found  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
that:  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
Warg  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods. 
x

x
From  
x

x
these  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
news:  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
patrols  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
with  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
fiercely  
x

x
angry  
x

x
  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
burning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
wolfs  
x

x
  
x

x
nose  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard’s  
x

x
fire  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
chief  
x

x
servants. 
x

x
So  
x

x
much  
x

x
they  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
forced  
x

x
them,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
wickedness  
x

x
than  
x

x
this  
x

x
afoot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
raid  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
army  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
wolf-allies  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
shadowed  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
might  
x

x
soon  
x

x
be  
x

x
made  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
vengeance  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
that  
x

x
lived  
x

x
there,  
x

x
and  
x

x
who  
x

x
they  
x

x
thought  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
sheltering  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
story,  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
yours,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
“but  
x

x
I  
x

x
like  
x

x
it  
x

x
still  
x

x
better  
x

x
now  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
true. 
x

x
You  
x

x
must  
x

x
forgive  
x

x
my  
x

x
not  
x

x
taking  
x

x
your  
x

x
word. 
x

x
  
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
lived  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
take  
x

x
the  
x

x
word  
x

x
of  
x

x
no

you

know

as  
x

x
your

brother

x
or  
x

x
better. 
x

x
As  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
only  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
home  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
you

were

safe,

and

to

offer

you

any

help  
x

x
that

I

can. 
x

x
I  
x

x
shall

think  
x

x
more  
x

x
kindly  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
after  
x

x
this. 
x

x
Killed  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin,  
x

x
  
x

x
killed  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
Goblin!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
chuckled  
x

x
fiercely  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
did  
x

x
you  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Warg?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
suddenly. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
and  
x

x
see!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
house. 
x

x
A  
x

x
goblin’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
outside  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
warg-skin  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
nailed  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
just  
x

x
beyond. 
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
  
x

x
enemy. 
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
friend,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
wise  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
him  
x

x
their  
x

x
whole  
x

x
  
x

x
story  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
reason  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
help  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
offer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
promised  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
for  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
provide  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
for  
x

x
each  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
horse  
x

x
for  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
lade  
x

x
them  
x

x
with  
x

x
food  
x

x
to  
x

x
last  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
weeks  
x

x
with  
x

x
care,  
x

x
and  
x

x
packed  
x

x
so  
x

x
as  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
easy  
x

x
as  
x

x
possible  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
—  
x

x

sealed  
x

x
  
x

x
jars  
x

of  
x

x
dried

fruits,

and

red  
x

earthenware  
x

x
pots  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
honey,  
x

x
and  
x

x
twice-baked  
x

x
cakes  
x

x
that

would  
x

x
keep  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
march  
x

x
far. 
x

x
The  
x

x
making  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
was  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
secrets;  
x

x
but  
x

x
honey  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
them,  
x

x
as  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
foods,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
good  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
one  
x

x
thirsty. 
x

x
Water,  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
need  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
this  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
for  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
streams  
x

x
and  
x

x
springs  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
road. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
your  
x

x
way  
x

x
through  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
and  
x

x
difficult,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Water  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
easy  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
there,  
x

x
nor  
x

food. 
x

x
The

time

is  
x

not

yet

come

it

may

be

past  
x

and  
x

x
gone

indeed

before

you

all

that

there

x
in

there  
x

x
the  
x

x
wild  
x

x
things  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
queer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
savage. 
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
provide  
x

x
you

with

skins

for

carrying

water,

I

will

give

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

bows

and

arrows. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I

doubt

very

much  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
anything  
x

x
you  
x

find  
x

x
in  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
wholesome  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
drink. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
stream  
x

x
there,  
x

x
I  
x

x
know,  
x

x
black  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
crosses  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
That  
x

x
you  
x

x
should  
x

x
neither  
x

x
drink  
x

x
  
x

x
of,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
bathe  
x

x
in;  
x

x
for  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
carries  
x

x
  
x

x
enchantment  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
drowsiness  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
forgetfulness. 
x

x
And  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dim  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

place  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t

x
think  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
shoot  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
  
x

x
wholesome  
x

x
or  
x

x
unwholesome,  
x

x
without  
x

x
straying  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
That  
x

x
you  
x

x
MUST  
x

x
NOT  
x

x
do,  
x

x
for  
x

x
any

reason.

x

“That

is

all

the

advice

I

can

Beyond

the

edge

of

the

I

help

you

much;

you

must

on

your

luck

your

courage

the

food

I

At

gate

of

the

forest

I

must

ask

you

to

send

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
my

horse  
x

and  
x

x
my

ponies. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

wish  
x

x
you  
x

all  
x

x
  
x

x
speed,

and

my

house

open

if

ever

you

back

this

way

again.’’  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
thanked  
x

x
him,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
bows  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
sweepings  
x

x
of

their

and  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
“at

your

service,

O

of

the  
x

wide  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
  
x

x
halls!”  
x

x
But  
x

x
their  
x

x
spirits  
x

x
sank  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
grave  
x

x
words,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
felt  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
was  
x

x
far  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
than  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
while  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
time,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
passed  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
perils  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
road,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
was  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
that  
x

x
morning  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
busy  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
preparations. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
after  
x

x
midday  
x

x
they  
x

x
ate  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
meal  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
mounted  
x

x
the  
x

x
steeds  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
lending  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bidding  
x

x
him  
x

x
many  
x

x
farewells  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
his  
x

x
gate  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
pace. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
left  
x

x
his  
x

x
high  
x

x
hedges  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
east  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
fenced  
x

x
lands  
x

x
they  
x

x
turned  
x

x
north  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
bore  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
north-west. 
x

x
By  
x

x
his  
x

x
advice  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
making  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
forest-road  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
south  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
land. 
x

x
Had  
x

x
they  
x

x
followed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
pass,  
x

x
their  
x

x
path  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
led  
x

x
them  
x

x
down  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stream  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
that  
x

x
joined  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
river  
x

x
miles  
x

x
south  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock. 
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
point  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
ford  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
passed,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
still  
x

x
had  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
track  
x

x
led  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
skirts  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
forest  
x

x
road. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
warned  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
often  
x

x
used  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-road  
x

x
  
x

x
itself,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard,  
x

x
was  
x

x
overgrown  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
disused  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
end  
x

x
and  
x

x
led  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
impassable  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
paths  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
lost. 
x

x
Its  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
opening  
x

x
had  
x

x
also  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
far  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
south  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
left  
x

x
them  
x

x
still  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
northward  
x

x
march  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
side. 
x

x
North  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

Mirkwood  
x

x
drew  
x

closer

to

the

borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

Great

River,

and

though  
x

x
here  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
too  
x

x

drew

down

nearer,

Beorn  
x

x
advised  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
way;  
x

x
for  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
days’  
x

x
ride  
x

x
due  
x

x
  
x

x
north  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
little-  
x

x
  
x

x
known  
x

x
pathway  
x

x
through  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
that  
x

x
led  
x

x
  
x

x
almost  
x

x
straight  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
goblins,”  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“will  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
River  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
miles  
x

x
  
x

x
north  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock  
x

x
nor  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
near  
x

x
my  
x

x
house  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
well  
x

x
protected  
x

x
at  
x

x
night!  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
ride  
x

x
  
x

x
fast;  
x

x
for  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
make  
x

x
their  
x

x
raid  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
cross  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
south  
x

x
and  
x

x
scour  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
so  
x

x
as  
x

x
to  
x

x
cut  
x

x
you  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
run  
x

x
swifter  
x

x
than  
x

x
ponies. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
safer  
x

x
going  
x

x
north,  
x

x
even  
x

x
though  
x

x
you  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
back  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
strongholds;  
x

x
for  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
least  
x

x
expect,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
longer  
x

x
ride  
x

x
to  
x

x
catch  
x

x
you. 
x

x
Be  
x

x
off  
x

x
now  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
may!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
riding  
x

x
in  
x

x
silence,  
x

x
  
x

x
galloping  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
was  
x

x
grassy  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
smooth,  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
dark  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
left,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance  
x

x
the  
x

x
line  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
ever  
x

x
closer. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
had  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
west  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
started,  
x

x
and  
x

x
till  
x

x
evening  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
lay  
x

x
golden  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
about  
x

x
them. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
pursuing  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
put  
x

x
many  
x

x
miles  
x

x
between  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
house  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
talk  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sing  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
forget  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
forest-path  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
in  
x

x
front. 
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
evening  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dusk  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
peaks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
  
x

x
glowered  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
sunset  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
camp  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
a  
x

x
guard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
slept  
x

x
  
x

x
uneasily  
x

x
with  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
howl  
x

x
of  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
cries  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
the  
x

x
next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
dawned  
x

x
bright  
x

x
and  
x

x
fair  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
autumn-like  
x

x
mist  
x

x
white  
x

x
  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
was  
x

x
chill,  
x

x
but  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
rose  
x

x
red  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
East  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
mists  
x

x
  
x

x
vanished,  
x

x
and  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
off  
x

x
again. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
now  
x

x
for  
x

x
two  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
days,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
save  
x

x
grass  
x

x
and  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
and  
x

x
birds  
x

x
and  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
occasionally  
x

x
small  
x

x
herds  
x

x
of  
x

x
red  
x

x
deer  
x

x
  
x

x
browsing  
x

x
or  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
at  
x

x
noon  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shade. 
x

x
  
x

x
Sometimes  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
horns  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
harts  
x

x
  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
up  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
dead  
x

x
branches  
x

x
of  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
third  
x

x
evening  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
so  
x

x
eager  
x

x
to  
x

x
press  
x

x
  
x

x
on,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
should  
x

x
reach  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-gate  
x

x
early  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
fourth-day,  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
rode  
x

x
still  
x

x
forward  
x

x
after  
x

x
dusk  
x

x
and  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon. 
x

x
As  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
faded  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
right,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
left,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadowy  
x

x
form  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
bear  
x

x
prowling  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
But  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
mention  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
only  
x

x
said:  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hush!  
x

x
Take  
x

x
no  
x

x
notice!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Next  
x

x
day  
x

x
they  
x

x
started  
x

x
before  
x

x
dawn,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
night  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
short. 
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
coming  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
them,  
x

x
or  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
them  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
frowning  
x

x
wall  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
land  
x

x
began  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
slope  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
silence  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
draw  
x

x
in  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
Birds  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
less. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
deer;  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
rabbits  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen. 
x

x
By  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
eaves  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
resting  
x

x
almost  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
overhanging  
x

x
boughs  
x

x
of  
x

x
its  
x

x
outer  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
trunks  
x

x
were  
x

x
huge  
x

x
and  
x

x
gnarled,  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
branches  
x

x
twisted,  
x

x
their  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
were  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
long. 
x

x
Ivy  
x

x
grew  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
trailed  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
here  
x

x
is  
x

x
Mirkwood!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
greatest  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
forests  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Northern  
x

x
  
x

x
world. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
you  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
look  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
send  
x

x
back  
x

x
these  
x

x
excellent  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
borrowed.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
grumble  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
this,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
fools. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Beorn  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
think,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
keep  
x

x
your  
x

x
promises  
x

x
anyway,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
enemy. 
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
sharper  
x

x
than  
x

x
yours,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
seen  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
after  
x

x
dark  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
bear  
x

x
going  
x

x
along  
x

x
with  
x

x
us  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
watching  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
camps. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
only  
x

x
to  
x

x
guard  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
guide  
x

x
you,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
an  
x

x
eye  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
too. 
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
your  
x

x
friend,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
loves  
x

x
his  
x

x
animals  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
children. 
x

x
You  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
guess  
x

x
what  
x

x
kindness  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
shown  
x

x
you  
x

x
in  
x

x
letting  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
ride  
x

x
them  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
fast,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
happen  
x

x
to  
x

x
you,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
them  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
horse,  
x

x
then?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
mention  
x

x
sending  
x

x
that  
x

x
back.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t,  
x

x
because  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
not  
x

x
sending  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
your  
x

x
promise  
x

x
then?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
look  
x

x
after  
x

x
that. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
not  
x

x
sending  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
horse  
x

x
back,  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
riding  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
leave  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
despair. 
x

x
But  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
say  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
change  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
we  
x

x
had  
x

x
this  
x

x
all  
x

x
out  
x

x
before,  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
landed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
Carrock,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
use  
x

x
  
x

x
arguing. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have,  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
told  
x

x
you,  
x

x
some  
x

x
pressing  
x

x
  
x

x
business  
x

x
away  
x

x
south;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
already  
x

x
late  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
bothering  
x

x
with  
x

x
you  
x

x
people. 
x

x
We  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
meet  
x

x
again  
x

x
before  
x

x
all  
x

x
is  
x

x
over,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
again  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
we  
x

x
may  
x

x
not. 
x

x
That  
x

x
depends  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
luck  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
courage  
x

x
and  
x

x
sense;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
sending  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
with  
x

x
you. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
told  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
guess,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
find  
x

x
that  
x

x
out  
x

x
before  
x

x
long. 
x

x
So  
x

x
  
x

x
cheer  
x

x
up  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
look  
x

x
so  
x

x
glum. 
x

x
Cheer  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Company!  
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
your  
x

x
expedition  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Think  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
forget  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
tomorrow  
x

x
morning!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
tomorrow  
x

x
morning  
x

x
came  
x

x
he  
x

x
still  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
same. 
x

x
So  
x

x
now  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
left  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
fill  
x

x
their  
x

x
water-skins  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
clear  
x

x
spring  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
unpack  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ponies. 
x

x
They  
x

x
distributed  
x

x
the  
x

x
packages  
x

x
as  
x

x
fairly  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could,  
x

x
though  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
thought  
x

x
his  
x

x
lot  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
wearisomely  
x

x
heavy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
trudging  
x

x
for  
x

x
miles  
x

x
and  
x

x
miles  
x

x
with  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
worry!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
lighter  
x

x
all  
x

x
too  
x

x
soon. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
all  
x

x
wish  
x

x
our  
x

x
packs  
x

x
heavier,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
food  
x

x
  
x

x
begins  
x

x
to  
x

x
run  
x

x
short.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
said  
x

x
good-bye  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
for  
x

x
home. 
x

x
Off  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
gaily,  
x

x
seeming  
x

x
very  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
put  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
tails  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
away  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
sworn  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
thing  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
bear  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
shambled  
x

x
off  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
after  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
too  
x

x
said  
x

x
farewell. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
very  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
and  
x

x
wishing  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
beside  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
tall  
x

x
horse. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
gone  
x

x
just  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
after  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
(a  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
poor  
x

x
one),  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
as  
x

x
dark  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning  
x

x
as  
x

x
at  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
secret:  
x

x
  
x

x
“a  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
watching  
x

x
and  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
feeling,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good-bye!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
  
x

x
goodbye  
x

x
to  
x

x
you  
x

x
all,  
x

x
good-bye!  
x

x
Straight  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
is  
x

x
your  
x

x
way  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Don’t  
x

x
stray  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
track!  
x

x
—  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
do,  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
find  
x

x
it  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood;  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
I,  
x

x
or  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
else,  
x

x
will  
x

x
ever  
x

x
see  
x

x
you  
x

x
again.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Do  
x

x
we  
x

x
really  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
through?”  
x

x
groaned  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes,  
x

x
you  
x

x
do!”  
x

said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
“if  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side. 
x

x
You  
x

x
must  
x

x
either  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
or  
x

x
give  
x

x
up  
x

x
your

x
quest. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I

am  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
going

to

x
allow

you

to

back  
x

x
out  
x

x
now,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
ashamed  
x

x
of  
x

x
you  
x

x
for  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
these  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
laughed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No!  
x

x
no!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
didn’t  
x

x
mean  
x

x
that. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
meant,

x
is  
x

x
there  
x

x
no  
x

x
way  
x

x
round?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
care  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
two  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
  
x

x
miles  
x

x
or  
x

x
so  
x

x
out  
x

of  
x

your

way

north,  
x

x
and  
x

x
twice  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
south. 
x

x
But  
x

x
you  
x

x
wouldn’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
a  
x

x
safe  
x

x
path  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
then. 
x

x
There

are  
x

x
no

safe  
x

x
paths  
x

x
in  
x

x
this

part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

world. 
x

x
Remember  
x

x
you

are

over

the

Edge

the

Wild

now,

and  
x

x
in

x
for  
x

x
all

sorts  
x

x
of  
x

x
fun  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
you  
x

x

go. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
you

could  
x

get  
x

x
round  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
North  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
right  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Grey  
x

x
Mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
simply  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
hobgoblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ores  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
worst  
x

x
  
x

x
description. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
round  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
South,  
x

x
you  
x

would

get  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Necromancer;  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
you,  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
need  
x

x
  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
tales  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
black  
x

x
sorcerer. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
advise  
x

x
you  
x

x
to

go  
x

x
anywhere  
x

x
near  
x

x
the

places  
x

x
  
x

x
overlooked

by  
x

x
his

dark

tower!  
x

x
Stick  
x

x
to  
x

x
the

forest-track,  
x

x
keep  
x

x
your

spirits

x
up,

hope  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
best,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
slice  
x

x
of  
x

x
luck  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
  
x

x
Marshes  
x

x
lying  
x

x
below  
x

x
you,  
x

x
and  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
East,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
dear  
x

x
old  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
lives,  
x

x
though  
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
expecting  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
comforting  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
sure,”  
x

x
  
x

x
growled  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Good-bye!  
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
us,  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
get  
x

x
off  
x

x
without  
x

x
any  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
talk!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good-bye  
x

x
then,  
x

x
and  
x

x
really  
x

x
good-bye!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
his  
x

x
horse  
x

x
and  
x

x
rode  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
West. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
resist  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
temptation  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
word. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
passed  
x

x
quite  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
hearing  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
and  
x

x
called  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice  
x

x
come  
x

x
faintly:  
x

x
“Good-bye!  
x

x
Be  
x

x
  
x

x
good,  
x

x
take  
x

x
care  
x

x
of  
x

x
yourselves  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
DON’T  
x

x
  
x

x
LEAVE  
x

x
THE  
x

x
PATH!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
galloped  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
soon  
x

x
lost  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
sight. 
x

x
“O  
x

x
good-bye  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
away!”  
x

x
grunted  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
more  
x

x
angry  
x

x
because  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
dismay  
x

x
at  
x

x
losing  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
journey. 
x

x
They  
x

x
each  
x

x
shouldered  
x

x
the  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
pack  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
water-skin  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
share,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
  
x

x
outside  
x

x
and  
x

x
plunged  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest.

x

x
FLIES  
x

x
AND  
x

x
SPIDERS  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
walked  
x

x
in  
x

x
single  
x

x
file. 
x

x
The  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
path  
x

x
was  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
arch  
x

x
leading  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
two  
x

x
great  
x

x
trees  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
leant  
x

x
together,  
x

x
too  
x

x
old  
x

x
and  
x

x
strangled  
x

x
with  
x

x
ivy  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
hung  
x

x
with  
x

x
lichen  
x

x
to  
x

x
bear  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
blackened  
x

x
leaves. 
x

x
The  
x

x
path  
x

x
itself  
x

x
was  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wound  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
trunks. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
was  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
bright  
x

x
hole  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
deep  
x

x
that  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
feet  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
thump  
x

x
along  
x

x
while  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
leaned  
x

x
over  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
listened. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
became  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dimness  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
either  
x

x
side  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
sort  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
darkened  
x

x
green  
x

x
glimmer. 
x

x
Occasionally  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
slender  
x

x
beam  
x

x
of  
x

x
sun  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
luck  
x

x
to  
x

x
slip  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
some  
x

x
opening  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
far  
x

x
above,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
more  
x

x
luck  
x

x
in  
x

x
not  
x

x
being  
x

x
caught  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tangled  
x

x
boughs  
x

x
and  
x

x
matted  
x

x
twigs  
x

x
beneath,  
x

x
  
x

x
stabbed  
x

x
down  
x

x
thin  
x

x
and  
x

x
bright  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
seldom,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
soon  
x

x
ceased  
x

x
altogether. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
black  
x

x
squirrels  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
As  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
inquisitive  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
got  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
seeing  
x

x
things  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
catch  
x

x
glimpses  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
whisking  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
and  
x

x
scuttling  
x

x
behind  
x

x
tree-  
x

x
  
x

x
trunks. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
queer  
x

x
noises  
x

x
too,  
x

x
grunts,  
x

x
  
x

x
scufflings,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hurryings  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
undergrowth,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
piled  
x

x
endlessly  
x

x
thick  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
places  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-floor;  
x

x
but  
x

x
what  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
noises  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see. 
x

x
The  
x

x
nastiest  
x

x
things  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
cobwebs:  
x

x
dark  
x

x
dense  
x

x
  
x

x
cobwebs  
x

x
with  
x

x
threads  
x

x
extraordinarily  
x

x
thick,  
x

x
  
x

x
often  
x

x
stretched  
x

x
from  
x

x
tree  
x

x
to  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
or  
x

x
tangled  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
branches  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
none  
x

x
stretched  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
path,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
whether  
x

x
because  
x

x
some  
x

x
magic  
x

x
kept  
x

x
it  
x

x
clear,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
what  
x

x
other  
x

x
reason  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
guess. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
grew  
x

x
to  
x

x
hate  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest  
x

x
as  
x

x
heartily  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
hated  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnels  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
offer  
x

x
even  
x

x
less  
x

x
  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
ending. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
on,  
x

x
long  
x

x
after  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
sick  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sun  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky,  
x

x
and  
x

x
longed  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
feel  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
wind  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
faces. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
movement  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
air  
x

x
down  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-roof,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
everlastingly  
x

x
still  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuffy. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
felt  
x

x
it,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
tunnelling,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lived  
x

x
at  
x

x
times  
x

x
for  
x

x
long  
x

x
whiles  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
who  
x

x
liked  
x

x
holes  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
house  
x

x
in  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
spend  
x

x
summer  
x

x
days  
x

x
in,  
x

x
felt  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
being  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
suffocated. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
nights  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
worst. 
x

x
It  
x

x
then  
x

x
became  
x

x
  
x

x
pitch-dark  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
what  
x

x
you  
x

x
call  
x

x
pitch-dark,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
pitch:  
x

x
so  
x

x
black  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
really  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
tried  
x

x
flapping  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
nose,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Well,  
x

x
  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
true  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing:  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
They  
x

x
slept  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
closely  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
together,  
x

x
and  
x

x
took  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
turns  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
watch;  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
turn  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
gleams  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
round  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
pairs  
x

x
of  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
or  
x

x
red  
x

x
or  
x

x
green  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
stare  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
fade  
x

x
and  
x

x
disappear  
x

x
and  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
shine  
x

x
out  
x

x
again  
x

x
in  
x

x
another  
x

x
place. 
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
branches  
x

x
just  
x

x
above  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
terrifying. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
liked  
x

x
the  
x

x
least  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
pale  
x

x
bulbous  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
“Insect  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
“not  
x

x
animal  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
only  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
much  
x

x
too  
x

x
big.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Although  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
very  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
they  
x

x
tried  
x

x
  
x

x
lighting  
x

x
watch-fires  
x

x
at  
x

x
night,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
soon  
x

x
gave  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
up. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
them,  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
creatures,  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
they  
x

x
were,  
x

x
were  
x

x
careful  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
their  
x

x
bodies  
x

x
show  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
flicker  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
Worse  
x

x
still  
x

x
it  
x

x
brought  
x

x
thousands  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
dark-grey  
x

x
and  
x

x
black  
x

x
moths,  
x

x
some  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
as  
x

x
big  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
your  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
flapping  
x

x
and  
x

x
whirring  
x

x
round  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
ears. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
stand  
x

x
that,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
the  
x

x
huge  
x

x
  
x

x
bats,  
x

x
black  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
top-hat,  
x

x
either;  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
gave  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
fires  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
at  
x

x
night  
x

x
and  
x

x
dozed  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
uncanny  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
this  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
what  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
ages  
x

x
upon  
x

x
ages;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
extremely  
x

x
careful  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
provisions. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
so,  
x

x
as  
x

x
days  
x

x
followed  
x

x
days,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
just  
x

x
the  
x

x
same,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
anxious. 
x

x
The  
x

x
food  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever:  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
already  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
low. 
x

x
They  
x

x
tried  
x

x
shooting  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
squirrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
wasted  
x

x
many  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
managed  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
one  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
But  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
roasted  
x

x
it,  
x

x
it  
x

x
proved  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
to  
x

x
taste,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
shot  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
squirrels. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
thirsty  
x

x
too,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
none  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
neither  
x

x
spring  
x

x
nor  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
state  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
their  
x

x
path  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
running  
x

x
water. 
x

x
It  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
fast  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
wide  
x

x
right  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
black,  
x

x
or  
x

x
looked  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
well  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
warned  
x

x
them  
x

x
against  
x

x
it,  
x

x
or  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
drunk  
x

x
from  
x

x
it,  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
its  
x

x
colour,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
filled  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
emptied  
x

x
skins  
x

x
at  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
As  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
they  
x

x
only  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
how  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
cross  
x

x
it  
x

x
without  
x

x
wetting  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
water. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
of  
x

x
wood  
x

x
across,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
rotted  
x

x
and  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
broken  
x

x
  
x

x
posts  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
kneeling  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
brink  
x

x
and  
x

x
peering  
x

x
  
x

x
forward  
x

x
cried:  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
boat  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
bank!  
x

x
Now  
x

x
why  
x

x
couldn’t  
x

x
it  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
this  
x

x
side!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“How  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
think  
x

x
it  
x

x
is?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
for  
x

x
by  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sharpest  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
among  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
far. 
x

x
I  
x

x
shouldn’t  
x

x
think  
x

x
above  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
  
x

x
yards.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Twelve  
x

x
yards!  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
thirty  
x

x
at  
x

x
least,  
x

x
but  
x

x
my  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
see  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
used  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
years  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
  
x

x
yards  
x

x
is  
x

x
as  
x

x
good  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
mile. 
x

x
We  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
jump  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
daren’t  
x

x
try  
x

x
to  
x

x
wade  
x

or  
x

x
swim.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Can  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
you  
x

x
throw  
x

x
a  
x

x
rope?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What’s  
x

x
the  
x

x
good  
x

x
of  
x

x
that?  
x

x
The

boat

is  
x

x
sure

to

be

tied

up,

even

if

we

could

hook

it,

which

I

doubt.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

x
don’t

x
believe  
x

x
it

is

tied,”  
x

said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“though  
x

of

course

I

can’t

sure  
x

x
in

this

light;

but  
x

it  
x

x
looks  
x

x

to

x
me  
x

x
as

if

it

was

just

drawn

up

on

the

bank,  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
is  
x

x
low  
x

x
just  
x

x
there

where  
x

the

path

goes  
x

down

into

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dori  
x

is  
x

the

strongest,

x

x
Fili

is  
x

the

x
  
x

x
youngest  
x

and  
x

x
still

has

the

best

sight,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Come

here  
x

x
Fili,

and  
x

see

if

you

can

see

the

boat

Mr.

Baggins

talking

about.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
could;  
x

x
so  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
stared  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
an  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
brought  
x

x
him  
x

x
a  
x

x
rope. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
several  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
longest  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
fastened  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
large  
x

x
iron  
x

x
hooks  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
used  
x

x
for  
x

x
catching  
x

x
their  
x

x
packs  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
straps  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
their  
x

x
shoulders. 
x

x
Fili  
x

x
took  
x

x
this  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
  
x

x
balanced  
x

x
it  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
flung  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Splash  
x

x
it  
x

x
fell  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
water!  
x

x
“Not  
x

x
far  
x

x
enough!”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
peering  
x

x
forward. 
x

x
“A  
x

x
couple  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
feet  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
it  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
boat. 
x

x
Try  
x

x
again. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
the  
x

x
magic  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
strong  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
hurt  
x

x
you,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
just  
x

x
touch  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
wet  
x

x
rope.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
picked  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
hook  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
back,  
x

x
rather  
x

x
doubtfully  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same. 
x

x
This  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
threw  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
great  
x

x
strength. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Steady!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“you  
x

x
have  
x

x
thrown  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Draw  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
back  
x

x
gently.”  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
hauled  
x

x
the  
x

x
rope  
x

x
back  
x

x
slowly,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“Carefully!  
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
lying  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
boat;  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
hope  
x

x
the  
x

x
hook  
x

x
will  
x

x
catch.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
did. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rope  
x

x
went  
x

x
taut,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
vain. 
x

x
Kili  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
help,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gloin. 
x

x
They  
x

x
tugged  
x

x
and  
x

x
tugged,  
x

x
and  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
fell  
x

x
over  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
look  
x

x
out,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
rope,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
piece  
x

x
of  
x

x
stick  
x

x
fended  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
black  
x

x
boat  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
came  
x

x
rushing  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
“Help!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
seize  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
boat  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
floated  
x

x
off  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
current. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
tied  
x

x
after  
x

x
all,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he,  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
snapped  
x

x
painter  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
from  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
pull,  
x

x
my  
x

x
lads;  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
job  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
our  
x

x
rope  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
stronger.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who’ll  
x

x
cross  
x

x
first?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
shall,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
you

will

with

me,

and

Fili  
x

and

Balin. 
x

x
That’s  
x

x
as  
x

x
many  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
boat  
x

x
will

hold

at

a

time.

x
After

Oin

Dori;

“I’m

Bombur. 
x

x
“It’s  
x

x
somebody  
x

x
else’s  
x

x
turn  
x

x
today.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
should  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
so  
x

x
fat. 
x

x
As  
x

x
you  
x

x
are,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
be

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
last

and  
x

x
lightest  
x

x
boatload. 
x

x
  
x

x
Don’t  
x

x
start  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
against  
x

x
orders,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
something

bad

you.”

“There

aren’t

any

oars.

How

are

you

boat

back  
x

to  
x

x
the

x
far  
x

x
bank?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Give  
x

x
me  
x

x
another  
x

x
length  
x

x
of  
x

x
rope  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
hook,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
ready,  
x

x
he  
x

x
cast  
x

x
it  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
high  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
throw  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Since  
x

x
it  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
fall  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
again,  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches. 
x

x
“Get  
x

x
in  
x

x
now,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
one

x
  
x

x

x

of

you

on

the

that

is

stuck

in

a

tree

on

the

other

side. 
x

x
One  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

others

must

keep  
x

x

hold

of

the

hook

we

used  
x

at  
x

first,

and  
x

when

we

can  
x

hook  
x

it

x
on,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
you

can

draw

the

boat  
x

back.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
soon  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
bank  
x

x
safe  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
coiled  
x

x
rope  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
arm,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
(still  
x

x
grumbling)  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
follow,  
x

x
when  
x

x
something  
x

x
bad  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
happen. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
flying  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
hooves  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
ahead. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
shape  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
flying  
x

x
deer,  
x

x
it  
x

x
charged  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowled  
x

x
them  
x

x
over,  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
itself  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
leap. 
x

x
High  
x

x
it  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cleared  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
jump. 
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
reach  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
in  
x

x
safety. 
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
one  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
kept  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
landed  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
bent  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
bow  
x

x
and  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
an  
x

x
arrow  
x

x
in  
x

x
case  
x

x
any  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
  
x

x
guardian  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
boat  
x

x
appeared. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
he  
x

x
sent  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
swift  
x

x
and  
x

x
sure  
x

x
shot  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
beast. 
x

x
As  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
further  
x

x
bank  
x

x
it  
x

x
stumbled. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
swallowed  
x

x
it  
x

x
up,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
hooves  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
falter  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
go  
x

x
still. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
shout  
x

x
in  
x

x
praise  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shot,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
a  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
wail  
x

x
from  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
put  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
of  
x

x
venison  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
minds. 
x

x
“Bombur  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
in!  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
is  
x

x
drowning!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
true. 
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
had  
x

x
only  
x

x
one  
x

x
foot  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
hart  
x

x
bore  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
over  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
stumbled,  
x

x
thrusting  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
boat  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
toppled  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
water,  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
slipping  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
slimy  
x

x
roots  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
boat  
x

x
span  
x

x
  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
off  
x

x
and  
x

x
disappeared. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
still  
x

x
see  
x

x
his  
x

x
hood  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
ran  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
Quickly,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
flung  
x

x
a  
x

x
rope  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
hook  
x

x
towards  
x

x
him. 
x

x
His  
x

x
hand  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
drenched  
x

x
from  
x

x
hair  
x

x
to  
x

x
boots,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
worst. 
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
laid  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bank  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
already  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
with  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
hand  
x

x
clutching  
x

x
the  
x

x
rope  
x

x
so  
x

x
tight  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
it  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
grasp;  
x

x
and  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
remained  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
do. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
standing  
x

x
over  
x

x
him,  
x

x
cursing  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
ill  
x

x
luck,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur’s  
x

x
clumsiness,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lamenting  
x

x
the  
x

x
loss  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
boat  
x

x
which  
x

x
made  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
impossible  
x

x
for  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hart,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
became  
x

x
aware  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dim  
x

x
  
x

x
blowing  
x

x
of  
x

x
horns  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
dogs  
x

x
baying  
x

x
far  
x

x
off. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
fell  
x

x
silent;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
hunt  
x

x
going  
x

x
by  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
north  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
path,  
x

x
though  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
move. 
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
slept  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
smile  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
fat  
x

x
face,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
cared  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
troubles  
x

x
that  
x

x
vexed  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
some  
x

x
white  
x

x
deer,  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
hind  
x

x
and  
x

x
fawns  
x

x
as  
x

x
snowy  
x

x
white  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
hart  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
They  
x

x
glimmered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
could  
x

x
cry  
x

x
out  
x

x
three  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
and  
x

x
loosed  
x

x
off  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
bows. 
x

x
None  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
mark. 
x

x
The  
x

x
deer  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
vanished  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
silently  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
shot  
x

x
their  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
after  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Stop!  
x

x
stop!”  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
late,  
x

x
the  
x

x
excited  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
wasted  
x

x
their  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
arrows,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
bows  
x

x
that  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
useless. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
party  
x

x
that  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
still  
x

x
deeper  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
following  
x

x
days. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
stream;  
x

x
but  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
it  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
straggle  
x

x
on  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
before,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
no  
x

x
change. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
known  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
considered  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
meaning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hunt  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
white  
x

x
deer  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
upon  
x

x
their  
x

x
path,  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
known  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
edge,  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
soon  
x

x
have  
x

x
come,  
x

x
  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
kept  
x

x
up  
x

x
their  
x

x
courage  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
hope,  
x

x
to  
x

x
thinner  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
places  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sunlight  
x

x
came  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
this,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
burdened  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
body  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
along  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
best  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could,  
x

x
taking  
x

x
the  
x

x
wearisome  
x

x
task  
x

x
in  
x

x
turns  
x

x
of  
x

x
four  
x

x
  
x

x
each  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
shared  
x

x
their  
x

x
packs. 
x

x
If  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
become  
x

x
all  
x

x
too  
x

x
light  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
days,  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
never  
x

x
have  
x

x
managed  
x

x
it;  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
slumbering  
x

x
and  
x

x
smiling  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
poor  
x

x
  
x

x
exchange  
x

x
for  
x

x
packs  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
food  
x

x
however  
x

x
  
x

x
heavy. 
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
days  
x

x
a  
x

x
time  
x

x
came  
x

x
when  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
practically  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
left  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
drink. 
x

x
  
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
wholesome  
x

x
could  
x

x
they  
x

x
see  
x

x
growing  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
only  
x

x
funguses  
x

x
and  
x

x
herbs  
x

x
with  
x

x
pale  
x

x
  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
and  
x

x
unpleasant  
x

x
smell. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
About  
x

x
four  
x

x
days  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
stream  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
part  
x

x
where  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
beeches. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
cheered  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
change,  
x

x
for  
x

x
here  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
undergrowth  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
deep. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
greenish  
x

x
light  
x

x
about  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
places  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
some  
x

x
distance  
x

x
to  
x

x
either  
x

x
  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
only  
x

x
showed  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
endless  
x

x
lines  
x

x
of  
x

x
straight  
x

x
grey  
x

x
trunks  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
huge  
x

x
twilight  
x

x
hall. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
breath  
x

x
of  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sad  
x

x
sound. 
x

x
A  
x

x
few  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
came  
x

x
rustling  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
remind  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
outside  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
was  
x

x
coming  
x

x
  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
ruffled  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
dead  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
countless  
x

x
other  
x

x
autumns  
x

x
that  
x

x
drifted  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
banks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
deep  
x

x
red  
x

x
carpets  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
slept  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
grew  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
weary. 
x

x
At  
x

x
times  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
disquieting  
x

x
laughter. 
x

x
  
x

x
Sometimes  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
singing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance  
x

x
  
x

x
too. 
x

x
The  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fair  
x

x
voices  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
of  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
singing  
x

x
was  
x

x
beautiful,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
eerie  
x

x
and  
x

x
strange,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
comforted,  
x

x
rather  
x

x
they  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
on  
x

x
from  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
parts  
x

x
with  
x

x
what  
x

x
strength  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
left. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Two  
x

x
days  
x

x
later  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
their  
x

x
path  
x

x
going  
x

x
  
x

x
downwards,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
filled  
x

x
almost  
x

x
entirely  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
growth  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
oaks. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Is  
x

x
there  
x

x
no  
x

x
end  
x

x
to  
x

x
this  
x

x
accursed  
x

x
forest?”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Somebody  
x

x
must  
x

x
climb  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
can  
x

x
get  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
look  
x

x
round. 
x

x
The  
x

x
only  
x

x
way  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
choose  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
tallest  
x

x
tree  
x

x
that  
x

x
overhangs  
x

x
the  
x

x
path.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
“somebody”  
x

x
meant  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
chose  
x

x
him,  
x

x
because  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
use  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
climber  
x

x
must  
x

x
get  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
topmost  
x

x
  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
he  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
light  
x

x
enough  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
highest  
x

x
and  
x

x
slenderest  
x

x
branches  
x

x
to  
x

x
bear  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
Poor  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
had  
x

x
much  
x

x
practice  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
hoisted  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lowest  
x

x
branches  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
oak  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
grew  
x

x
right  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
path,  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
best  
x

x
he  
x

x
could. 
x

x
He  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
tangled  
x

x
twigs  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
slap  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
eye;  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
greened  
x

x
and  
x

x
grimed  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
bark  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
greater  
x

x
boughs;  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
once  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
and  
x

x
caught  
x

x
himself  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time;  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
last,  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
struggle  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
place  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
there  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
convenient  
x

x
  
x

x
branches  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
top. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
whether  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
and  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
(except  
x

x
by  
x

x
falling). 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
he  
x

x
poked  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
all  
x

x
right. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
only  
x

x
small  
x

x
ones  
x

x
of  
x

x
ordinary  
x

x
size,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
butterflies. 
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
blinded  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
light. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
up  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
below,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
answer,  
x

x
only  
x

x
hold  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
blink. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
was  
x

x
shining  
x

x
brilliantly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
bear  
x

x
it. 
x

x
When  
x

x
he  
x

x
could,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
a  
x

x
sea  
x

x
of  
x

x
dark  
x

x
green,  
x

x
  
x

x
ruffled  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
breeze;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
everywhere  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
butterflies. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
expect  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
kind  
x

x
of  
x

x
“purple  
x

x
emperor”,  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
butterfly  
x

x
that  
x

x
loves  
x

x
the  
x

x
tops  
x

x
of  
x

x
oak-woods,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
purple  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
velvety  
x

x
black  
x

x
without  
x

x
any  
x

x
markings  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
seen. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
“black  
x

x
emperors”  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
enjoyed  
x

x
the  
x

x
feel  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
breeze  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
hair  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
face;  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
length  
x

x
the  
x

x
cries  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
simply  
x

x
stamping  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
impatience  
x

x
down  
x

x
below,  
x

x
reminded  
x

x
him  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
real  
x

x
business. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good. 
x

x
Gaze  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
might,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
no  
x

x
end  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
in  
x

x
any  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
His  
x

x
heart,  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
lightened  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
feel  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
sank  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
toes:  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
food  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
down  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Actually,  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
told  
x

x
you,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest;  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sense  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
it,  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
climbed,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
tall  
x

x
in  
x

x
itself,  
x

x
was  
x

x
standing  
x

x
  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
from  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
top  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
swell  
x

x
up  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
edges  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
bowl,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
expect  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
how  
x

x
far  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
lasted. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
this,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
down  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
despair. 
x

x
He  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom  
x

x
again  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
  
x

x
scratched,  
x

x
hot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
miserable,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
anything  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
below  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
there. 
x

x
His  
x

x
report  
x

x
soon  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
forest  
x

x
goes  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever  
x

x
and  
x

x
ever  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
directions!  
x

x
Whatever  
x

x
shall  
x

x
we  
x

x
do?  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
use  
x

x
of  
x

x
sending  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit!"  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
fault. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
care  
x

x
  
x

x
tuppence  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
butterflies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
more  
x

x
angry  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
breeze,  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
climb  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
feel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
night  
x

x
they  
x

x
ate  
x

x
their  
x

x
very  
x

x
last  
x

x
scraps  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
crumbs  
x

x
of  
x

x
food;  
x

x
and  
x

x
next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
woke  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
thing  
x

x
they  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
gnawingly  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
next  
x

x
thing  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
raining  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
drip  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
dropping  
x

x
heavily  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
  
x

x
floor. 
x

x
That  
x

x
only  
x

x
reminded  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
parchingly  
x

x
thirsty,  
x

x
without  
x

x
doing  
x

x
anything  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
relieve  
x

x
them:  
x

x
you  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
quench  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
thirst  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
standing  
x

x
under  
x

x
giant  
x

x
oaks  
x

x
and  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
chance  
x

x
drip  
x

x
to  
x

x
fall  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
tongue. 
x

x
The  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
scrap  
x

x
of  
x

x
comfort  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
came  
x

x
unexpectedly  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
Bombur. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
up  
x

x
scratching  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
head. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
make  
x

x
out  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
so  
x

x
hungry;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
everything  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
since  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
started  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey  
x

x
that  
x

x
May  
x

x
morning  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
The  
x

x
last  
x

x
thing  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
party  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
house,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
difficulty  
x

x
in  
x

x
making  
x

x
him  
x

x
believe  
x

x
their  
x

x
tale  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
many  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
since. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
eat,  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
wept,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
very  
x

x
weak  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wobbly  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
legs. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
ever  
x

x
did  
x

x
I  
x

x
wake  
x

x
  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
was  
x

x
having  
x

x
such  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
  
x

x
dreams. 
x

x
I  
x

x
dreamed  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
walking  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
forest  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
one,  
x

x
only  
x

x
lit  
x

x
with  
x

x
torches  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
lamps  
x

x
swinging  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fires  
x

x
burning  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
feast  
x

x
going  
x

x
on,  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
A  
x

x
  
x

x
woodland  
x

x
king  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
crown  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
singing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
count  
x

x
or  
x

x
describe  
x

x
the  
x

x
things  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat  
x

x
and  
x

x
drink.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
need  
x

x
not  
x

x
try,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
talk  
x

x
about  
x

x
something  
x

x
else,  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
silent. 
x

x
We  
x

x
are  
x

x
quite  
x

x
annoyed  
x

x
enough  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
is. 
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
hadn’t  
x

x
waked  
x

x
up,  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
left  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
your  
x

x
idiotic  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest;  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
no  
x

x
joke  
x

x
to  
x

x
carry  
x

x
even  
x

x
after  
x

x
weeks  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
short  
x

x
commons.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
tighten  
x

x
the  
x

x
belts  
x

x
round  
x

x
their  
x

x
empty  
x

x
stomachs,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
hoist  
x

x
their  
x

x
empty  
x

x
sacks  
x

x
and  
x

x
packs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
trudge  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
track  
x

x
without  
x

x
any  
x

x
great  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
getting  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
died  
x

x
of  
x

x
starvation. 
x

x
This  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
day,  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
very  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
and  
x

x
wearily;  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
wailing  
x

x
that  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
carry  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
lie  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
sleep. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
your  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
take  
x

x
their  
x

x
share,  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
carried  
x

x
you  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
enough.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
he  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
refused  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
step  
x

x
further  
x

x
and  
x

x
flung  
x

x
himself  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
“Go  
x

x
  
x

x
on,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
must,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I’m  
x

x
just  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
lie  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
and  
x

x
dream  
x

x
of  
x

x
food,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
any  
x

x
other  
x

x
way. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
wake  
x

x
up  
x

x
again.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
very  
x

x
moment  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
ahead,  
x

x
called  
x

x
out:  
x

x
“What  
x

x
was  
x

x
that?  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
I  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
twinkle  
x

x
of  
x

x
light  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
all  
x

x
looked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
longish  
x

x
way  
x

x
off,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed,  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
twinkle  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark;  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
another  
x

x
and  
x

x
another  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
out  
x

x
beside  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
got  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
then,  
x

x
not  
x

x
caring  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
or  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
path,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
level  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
it,  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
plain  
x

x
that  
x

x
torches  
x

x
and  
x

x
fires  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
burning  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
way  
x

x
off  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
track. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
looks  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
my  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
were  
x

x
coming  
x

x
true,”  
x

x
  
x

x
gasped  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
up  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
He  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
rush  
x

x
straight  
x

x
off  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
lights. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
well  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
warnings  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
feast  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
good,  
x

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
never  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
alive  
x

x
from  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
feast  
x

x
we  
x

x
shan’t  
x

x
remain  
x

x
alive  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
longer  
x

x
anyway,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
heartily  
x

x
agreed  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
They  
x

x
argued  
x

x
about  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
backwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
forwards  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
while,  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
agreed  
x

x
at  
x

x
length  
x

x
to  
x

x
send  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
couple  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
spies,  
x

x
to  
x

x
creep  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
lights  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
out  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
agree  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
sent:  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
anxious  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
run  
x

x
the  
x

x
chance  
x

x
of  
x

x
being  
x

x
lost  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
finding  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
again. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
warnings,  
x

x
hunger  
x

x
decided  
x

x
them,  
x

x
because  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
describing  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
good  
x

x
things  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
being  
x

x
eaten,  
x

x
according  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
dream,  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
woodland  
x

x
feast;  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
plunged  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
together. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
creeping  
x

x
and  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
peered  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
trunks  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
clearing  
x

x
where  
x

x
some  
x

x
trees  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
felled  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
levelled. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
people  
x

x
  
x

x
there,  
x

x
elvish-looking  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
all  
x

x
dressed  
x

x
in  
x

x
green  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
brown  
x

x
and  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
sawn  
x

x
rings  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
felled  
x

x
trees  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
circle. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
midst  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
torches  
x

x
fastened  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
round  
x

x
about;  
x

x
but  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
splendid  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
all:  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
eating  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drinking  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
merrily. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
smell  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
roast  
x

x
meats  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
enchanting  
x

x
that,  
x

x
without  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
to  
x

x
consult  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
another,  
x

x
every  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
forwards  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
begging  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
food. 
x

x
No  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
clearing  
x

x
than  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
lights  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
by  
x

x
magic. 
x

x
Somebody  
x

x
  
x

x
kicked  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
went  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
rockets  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
glittering  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
and  
x

x
vanished. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
lost  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
completely  
x

x
lightless  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
find  
x

x
one  
x

x
another,  
x

x
not  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
rate. 
x

x
After  
x

x
blundering  
x

x
frantically  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom,  
x

x
  
x

x
falling  
x

x
over  
x

x
logs,  
x

x
bumping  
x

x
crash  
x

x
into  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
and  
x

x
calling  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
waked  
x

x
  
x

x
everything  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
for  
x

x
miles,  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
gather  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
bundle  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
count  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
by  
x

x
touch. 
x

x
By  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
quite  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
direction  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
hopelessly  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
least  
x

x
till  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
settle  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
were;  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
search  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
for  
x

x
scraps  
x

x
of  
x

x
food  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
fear  
x

x
of  
x

x
becoming  
x

x
separated  
x

x
again. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
lying  
x

x
long,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
drowsy,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
whose  
x

x
turn  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
watch  
x

x
first,  
x

x
said  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
whisper:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
lights  
x

x
are  
x

x
coming  
x

x
out  
x

x
again  
x

x
over  
x

x
there,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever  
x

x
of  
x

x
them.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Up  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
jumped. 
x

x
There,  
x

x
sure  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
were  
x

x
scores  
x

x
of  
x

x
twinkling  
x

x
lights,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
voices  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
plainly. 
x

x
They  
x

x
crept  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them,  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
single  
x

x
line,  
x

x
each  
x

x
touching  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
front. 
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
near  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“No  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
rushing  
x

x
forward  
x

x
this  
x

x
time!  
x

x
No  
x

x
one  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
stir  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
hiding  
x

x
till  
x

x
I  
x

x
say. 
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
send  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
alone  
x

x
  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
talk  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
—  
x

x
(‘What  
x

x
about  
x

x
me  
x

x
of  
x

x
them?’  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo)  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
any  
x

x
way  
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
they  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
do  
x

x
anything  
x

x
  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
to  
x

x
him.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
circle  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
lights  
x

x
they  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
slip  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
forward  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
full  
x

x
blaze  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
torches. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
went  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
lights  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
complete  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
If  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
collecting  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
  
x

x
before,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
far  
x

x
worse  
x

x
this  
x

x
time. 
x

x
And  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
simply  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
Every  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
counted  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
it  
x

x
only  
x

x
made  
x

x
thirteen. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
and  
x

x
called:  
x

x
“Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins!  
x

x
Hobbit!  
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
dratted  
x

x
hobbit!  
x

x
Hi!  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
confusticate  
x

x
you,  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
you?”  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
things  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
sort,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
just  
x

x
giving  
x

x
up  
x

x
hope,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
across  
x

x
him  
x

x
by  
x

x
sheer  
x

x
luck. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
over  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
log,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
curled  
x

x
up  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
to  
x

x
wake  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
awake  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
was  
x

x
having  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
lovely  
x

x
dream,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
grumbled,  
x

x
“all  
x

x
about  
x

x
having  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
gorgeous  
x

x
  
x

x
dinner.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
heavens!  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
gone  
x

x
like  
x

x
Bombur,”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
tell  
x

x
us

about  
x

x
dreams. 
x

x
Dream-  
x

x
  
x

x
dinners  
x

x
aren’t  
x

x
any  
x

x
good,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
share  
x

x
  
x

x
them.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
are  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
beastly  
x

x
place,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
muttered,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
beside  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
his  
x

x
dream  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lights  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
Later  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
old,  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
watching  
x

x
then,  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
roused  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
again,  
x

x
saying:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There’s  
x

x
a  
x

x
regular  
x

x
blaze  
x

x
of  
x

x
light  
x

x
begun  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
—  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
torches  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
fires  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
lit  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
magic. 
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
hark  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
singing  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
harps!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
lying  
x

x
and  
x

x
listening  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
resist  
x

x
the  
x

x
desire  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
and  
x

x
try  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
help. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
again;  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
result  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
disastrous. 
x

x
The  
x

x
feast  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
now  
x

x
saw  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
greater  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
magnificent  
x

x
than  
x

x
before;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
line  
x

x
of  
x

x
feasters  
x

x
sat  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
woodland  
x

x
king  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
crown  
x

x
of  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
upon  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
golden  
x

x
hair,  
x

x
very  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
described  
x

x
the  
x

x
figure  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
dream. 
x

x
The  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
  
x

x
folk  
x

x
were  
x

x
passing  
x

x
bowls  
x

x
from  
x

x
hand  
x

x
to  
x

x
hand  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
fires,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
were  
x

x
harping  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
were  
x

x
singing. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
gleaming  
x

x
hair  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
twined  
x

x
with  
x

x
flowers;  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
white  
x

x
gems  
x

x
  
x

x
glinted  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
collars  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
belts;  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
faces  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
songs  
x

x
were  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
mirth. 
x

x
  
x

x
Loud  
x

x
and  
x

x
clear  
x

x
and  
x

x
fair  
x

x
were  
x

x
those  
x

x
songs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
in  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
midst. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Dead  
x

x
silence  
x

x
fell  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
word. 
x

x
  
x

x
Out  
x

x
went  
x

x
all  
x

x
light. 
x

x
The  
x

x
fires  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
smokes. 
x

x
Ashes  
x

x
and  
x

x
cinders  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
again  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
clamour  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
cries. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
running  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
(as  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought)  
x

x
and  
x

x
calling  
x

x
and  
x

x
calling:  
x

x
“Dori,  
x

x
  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
Ori,  
x

x
Oin,  
x

x
Gloin,  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
Dwalin,  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield,”  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
people  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
or  
x

x
feel  
x

x
were  
x

x
doing  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
(with  
x

x
an  
x

x
occasional  
x

x
“Bilbo!”  
x

x
  
x

x
thrown  
x

x
in). 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
cries  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
further  
x

x
and  
x

x
fainter,  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
they  
x

x
changed  
x

x
to  
x

x
yells  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
cries  
x

x
for  
x

x
help  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
all  
x

x
noise  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
died  
x

x
right  
x

x
away,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
left  
x

x
alone  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
complete  
x

x
silence  
x

x
and  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
most  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
moments. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
soon  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
anything  
x

x
till  
x

x
day  
x

x
came  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
little  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
quite  
x

x
useless  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
blundering  
x

x
about  
x

x
tiring  
x

x
himself  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
no  
x

x
hope  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
to  
x

x
revive  
x

x
him. 
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
himself  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
fell  
x

x
to  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
far-distant  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
pantries. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
deep  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
of  
x

x
bacon  
x

x
and  
x

x
eggs  
x

x
and  
x

x
toast  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
butter  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
something  
x

x
touch  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
Something  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
strong  
x

x
sticky  
x

x
string  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
his  
x

x
left  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
move  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
were  
x

x
already  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
stuff,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
over. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
spider,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
busy  
x

x
  
x

x
tying  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
dozed,  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
at  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
only  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
thing’s  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
its  
x

x
hairy  
x

x
legs  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
struggled  
x

x
to  
x

x
wind  
x

x
its  
x

x
abominable  
x

x
threads  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
him. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
lucky  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
senses  
x

x
in  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
move  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
As  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
fight  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
free. 
x

x
He  
x

x
beat  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
creature  
x

x
off  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
hands  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
poison  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
him  
x

x
quiet,  
x

x
as  
x

x
small  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
flies  
x

x
—  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drew  
x

x
it  
x

x
out. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
cut  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
loose. 
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
turn  
x

x
to  
x

x
attack. 
x

x
The  
x

x
spider  
x

x
evidently  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
carried  
x

x
such  
x

x
stings  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
sides,  
x

x
or  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
quicker. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
came  
x

x
at  
x

x
it  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
disappear  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
right  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
it  
x

x
went  
x

x
mad  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
danced  
x

x
and  
x

x
flung  
x

x
out  
x

x
its  
x

x
legs  
x

x
in  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
jerks,  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
killed  
x

x
it  
x

x
with  
x

x
another  
x

x
stroke;  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
fell  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
more  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
usual  
x

x
dim  
x

x
grey  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest-day  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
senses. 
x

x
The  
x

x
spider  
x

x
lay  
x

x
dead  
x

x
beside  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword-blade  
x

x
was  
x

x
stained  
x

x
black. 
x

x
Somehow  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
killing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
giant  
x

x
spider,  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
help  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
or  
x

x
of  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
else,  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
difference  
x

x
to  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
He  
x

x
felt  
x

x
a  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
person,  
x

x
and  
x

x
much  
x

x
fiercer  
x

x
and  
x

x
bolder  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
empty  
x

x
stomach,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
wiped  
x

x
his  
x

x
sword  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
it  
x

x
back  
x

x
into  
x

x
its  
x

x
sheath. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
you  
x

x
a  
x

x
name,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
it,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
call  
x

x
you  
x

x
Sting.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
set  
x

x
out  
x

x
to  
x

x
explore. 
x

x
The  
x

x
forest  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
grim  
x

x
and  
x

x
silent,  
x

x
but  
x

x
obviously  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
first  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
off,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
(or  
x

x
worse  
x

x
things). 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
unsafe  
x

x
to  
x

x
shout,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
while  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
direction  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
direction  
x

x
he  
x

x
should  
x

x
go  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O!  
x

x
why  
x

x
did  
x

x
we  
x

x
not  
x

x
remember  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
  
x

x
advice,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gandalfs!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
lamented. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
mess  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
in  
x

x
now!  
x

x
We!  
x

x
I  
x

x
only  
x

x
wish  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
i/ie:  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
being  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
he  
x

x
made  
x

x
as  
x

x
good  
x

x
a  
x

x
guess  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
cries  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
help  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
luck  
x

x
(he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
born  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
it)  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
right,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
see. 
x

x
Having  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
along  
x

x
as  
x

x
cleverly  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could. 
x

x
Hobbits  
x

x
are  
x

x
clever  
x

x
at  
x

x
quietness,  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
in  
x

x
woods,  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
already  
x

x
told  
x

x
you;  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
started. 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
neither  
x

x
saw  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
him  
x

x
coming. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
picked  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
stealthily  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
of  
x

x
dense  
x

x
  
x

x
black  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
of  
x

x
him,  
x

x
black  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
patch  
x

x
of  
x

x
midnight  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
cleared  
x

x
away. 
x

x
As  
x

x
he  
x

x
drew  
x

x
nearer,  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
spider-webs  
x

x
one  
x

x
behind  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
tangled  
x

x
with  
x

x
another. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
saw,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
huge  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches  
x

x
above  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
ring  
x

x
or  
x

x
no  
x

x
ring  
x

x
he  
x

x
trembled  
x

x
with  
x

x
fear  
x

x
lest  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
discover  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Standing  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
watched  
x

x
a  
x

x
group  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
silence  
x

x
and  
x

x
stillness  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
realised  
x

x
that  
x

x
these  
x

x
loathsome  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
one  
x

x
to  
x

x
another. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
voices  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
thin  
x

x
creaking  
x

x
and  
x

x
hissing,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
out  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
words  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
talking  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
struggle,  
x

x
but  
x

x
worth  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
one. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
thick  
x

x
skins  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
sure,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I'll  
x

x
wager  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
good  
x

x
juice  
x

x
inside.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Aye,  
x

x
they’ll  
x

x
make  
x

x
fine  
x

x
eating,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they’ve  
x

x
  
x

x
hung  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
another. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
hang  
x

x
’em  
x

x
too  
x

x
long,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
third. 
x

x
  
x

x
“They’re  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
fat  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
might  
x

x
be. 
x

x
Been  
x

x
  
x

x
feeding  
x

x
none  
x

x
too  
x

x
well  
x

x
of  
x

x
late,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
guess.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Kill  
x

x
’em,  
x

x
I  
x

x
say,”  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
a  
x

x
fourth;  
x

x
“kill  
x

x
’em  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
hang  
x

x
’em  
x

x
dead  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They’re  
x

x
dead  
x

x
now,  
x

x
I’ll  
x

x
warrant,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
first. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
not. 
x

x
I  
x

x
saw  
x

x
one  
x

x
a-struggling  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
coming  
x

x
round  
x

x
again,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
say,  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
bee-autiful  
x

x
sleep. 
x

x
I’ll  
x

x
show  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
that  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fat  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
ran  
x

x
along  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rope  
x

x
till  
x

x
it  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
dozen  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
row  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
high  
x

x
branch. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
horrified,  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
them  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
dangling  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows,  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarvish  
x

x
foot  
x

x
  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottoms  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bundles,  
x

x
or  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
the  
x

x
tip  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
nose,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
beard  
x

x
or  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
hood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
the  
x

x
fattest  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
—  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
poor  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
I’ll  
x

x
bet,”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
nipped  
x

x
hard  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
nose  
x

x
that  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
  
x

x
out. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
muffled  
x

x
yelp  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
toe  
x

x
  
x

x
shot  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
kicked  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
straight  
x

x
and  
x

x
hard. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
life  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
still. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
kicking  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
flabby  
x

x
football,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
enraged  
x

x
spider  
x

x
fell  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch,  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
catching  
x

x
itself  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
own  
x

x
thread  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
others  
x

x
laughed. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
right,”  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“the  
x

x
meat’s  
x

x
alive  
x

x
and  
x

x
kicking!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I’ll  
x

x
soon  
x

x
put  
x

x
an  
x

x
end  
x

x
to  
x

x
that,”  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
angry  
x

x
spider  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
back  
x

x
onto  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
do  
x

x
something. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
up  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
brutes  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
to  
x

x
shoot  
x

x
with;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
looking  
x

x
about  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
place  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
stones  
x

x
lying  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
now  
x

x
dry  
x

x
little  
x

x
watercourse. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
  
x

x
fair  
x

x
shot  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
take  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
a  
x

x
nice  
x

x
smooth  
x

x
egg-shaped  
x

x
one  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
cosily. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
boy  
x

x
he  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
practise  
x

x
throwing  
x

x
stones  
x

x
at  
x

x
things,  
x

x
until  
x

x
rabbits  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
squirrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
got  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
him  
x

x
stoop;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
grownup  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
still  
x

x
spent  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
at  
x

x
quoits,  
x

x
dart-throwing,  
x

x
shooting  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wand,  
x

x
bowls,  
x

x
ninepins  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
games  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
aiming  
x

x
and  
x

x
throwing  
x

x
sort  
x

x
—  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
do  
x

x
lots  
x

x
of  
x

x
things,  
x

x
besides  
x

x
blowing  
x

x
smoke-rings,  
x

x
  
x

x
asking  
x

x
riddles  
x

x
and  
x

x
cooking,  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
about. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
time  
x

x
now. 
x

x
  
x

x
While  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
picking  
x

x
up  
x

x
stones,  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
reached  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
dead. 
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
threw. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
stone  
x

x
struck  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
plunk  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
head,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
senseless  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
flop  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
with  
x

x
all  
x

x
its  
x

x
legs  
x

x
curled  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
stone  
x

x
went  
x

x
whizzing  
x

x
through  
x

x
a  
x

x
big  
x

x
  
x

x
web,  
x

x
snapping  
x

x
its  
x

x
cords,  
x

x
and  
x

x
taking  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spider  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
whack,  
x

x
dead. 
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spider-colony,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
bit,  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
guess  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
stones  
x

x
were  
x

x
coming. 
x

x
As  
x

x
quick  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
running  
x

x
and  
x

x
swinging  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
flinging  
x

x
out  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
threads  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
directions,  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
waving  
x

x
snares. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
soon  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
different  
x

x
place. 
x

x
The  
x

x
idea  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
lead  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
furious  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
further  
x

x
and  
x

x
further  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
could;  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
them  
x

x
curious,  
x

x
  
x

x
excited  
x

x
and  
x

x
angry  
x

x
all  
x

x
at  
x

x
once. 
x

x
When  
x

x
about  
x

x
fifty  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
stood  
x

x
  
x

x
before,  
x

x
he  
x

x
threw  
x

x
some  
x

x
more  
x

x
stones  
x

x
at  
x

x
these,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
others  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
behind;  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
to  
x

x
infuriate  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
bring  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
hear  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
sang:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Old  
x

x
fat  
x

x
spider  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Old  
x

x
fat  
x

x
spider  
x

x
cant  
x

x
see  
x

x
me!  
x

x
  
x

x
Attercop!  
x

x
Attercop!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Wont  
x

x
you  
x

x
stop,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Stop  
x

x
your  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
and  
x

x
look  
x

x
forme?  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Old  
x

x
Tomnoddy,  
x

x
all  
x

x
big  
x

x
body,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Old  
x

x
Tomnoddy  
x

x
cant  
x

x
spy  
x

x
me!  
x

x
  
x

x
Attercop!  
x

x
Attercop!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down  
x

x
you  
x

x
drop!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Youll  
x

x
never  
x

x
catch  
x

x
me  
x

x
up  
x

x
your  
x

x
tree!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
very  
x

x
good  
x

x
perhaps,  
x

x
but  
x

x
then  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
it  
x

x
up  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spur  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
awkward  
x

x
moment. 
x

x
It  
x

x
did  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
any  
x

x
way. 
x

x
As  
x

x
he  
x

x
sang  
x

x
he  
x

x
threw  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
stones  
x

x
and  
x

x
stamped. 
x

x
Practically  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
came  
x

x
after  
x

x
him:  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
others  
x

x
raced  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
branches,  
x

x
swung  
x

x
from  
x

x
tree  
x

x
to  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
or  
x

x
cast  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
spaces. 
x

x
They  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
noise  
x

x
far  
x

x
quicker  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
expected. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
frightfully  
x

x
angry. 
x

x
Quite  
x

x
apart  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stones  
x

x
no  
x

x
spider  
x

x
has  
x

x
ever  
x

x
liked  
x

x
being  
x

x
called  
x

x
  
x

x
Attercop,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Tomnoddy  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
is  
x

x
insulting  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
anybody. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Off  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
scuttled  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
fresh  
x

x
place,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
several  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
had  
x

x
run  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
points  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
glade  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
lived,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
busy  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
webs  
x

x
across  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
spaces  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree-stems. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
caught  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
thick  
x

x
fence  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
him  
x

x
—  
x

x
that  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders’  
x

x
idea. 
x

x
  
x

x
Standing  
x

x
now  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
spinning  
x

x
insects  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
plucked  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
courage  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
began  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
song:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Lazy  
x

x
Lob  
x

x
and  
x

x
crazy  
x

x
Cob  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
weaving  
x

x
webs  
x

x
to  
x

x
wind  
x

x
me. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
far  
x

x
more  
x

x
sweet  
x

x
than  
x

x
other  
x

x
meat,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
they  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
find  
x

x
me!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
am  
x

x
I,  
x

x
naughty  
x

x
little  
x

x
fly;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
fat  
x

x
and  
x

x
lazy. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
trap  
x

x
me,  
x

x
though  
x

x
you  
x

x
try,  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
cobwebs  
x

x
crazy. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
space  
x

x
between  
x

x
two  
x

x
tall  
x

x
trees  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
closed  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
web  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
luckily  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
proper  
x

x
web,  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
strands  
x

x
of  
x

x
double-thick  
x

x
spider-rope  
x

x
run  
x

x
  
x

x
hastily  
x

x
backwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
forwards  
x

x
from  
x

x
trunk  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
trunk. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
came  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword. 
x

x
He  
x

x
slashed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
threads  
x

x
to  
x

x
pieces  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
singing. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
though  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
was,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
whole  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
came  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches,  
x

x
hairy  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
waving,  
x

x
nippers  
x

x
and  
x

x
spinners  
x

x
snapping,  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
  
x

x
popping,  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
froth  
x

x
and  
x

x
rage. 
x

x
They  
x

x
followed  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
until  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
dared. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
quieter  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
mouse  
x

x
he  
x

x
stole  
x

x
  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
precious  
x

x
little  
x

x
time,  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
disgusted  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
trees  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
hung. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
rescue  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
worst  
x

x
  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
job  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
up  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
branch  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
were  
x

x
dangling. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
managed  
x

x
it,  
x

x
if  
x

x
a  
x

x
spider  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
luckily  
x

x
left  
x

x
a  
x

x
rope  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
down;  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
help,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
and  
x

x
hurt  
x

x
him,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
up  
x

x
—  
x

x
only  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
slow  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
  
x

x
fat-bodied  
x

x
spider  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
remained  
x

x
behind  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
guard  
x

x
the  
x

x
prisoners,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
busy  
x

x
  
x

x
pinching  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
juiciest  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
eat. 
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
starting  
x

x
the  
x

x
feast  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
away,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
hurry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider  
x

x
knew  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
happening  
x

x
it  
x

x
felt  
x

x
his  
x

x
sting  
x

x
and  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
branch  
x

x
dead. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
next  
x

x
job  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
loose  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf. 
x

x
What  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
he  
x

x
to  
x

x
do?  
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
cut  
x

x
the  
x

x
string  
x

x
which  
x

x
hung  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
up,  
x

x
the  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
would  
x

x
tumble  
x

x
thump  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
way  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Wriggling  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch  
x

x
(which  
x

x
made  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
poor  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
dance  
x

x
and  
x

x
dangle  
x

x
like  
x

x
ripe  
x

x
fruit)  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
bundle. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Fili  
x

x
or  
x

x
Kili,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
tip  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
blue  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
sticking  
x

x
out  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top. 
x

x
“Most  
x

x
likely  
x

x
Fili,"  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
tip  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
nose  
x

x
poking  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
winding  
x

x
threads. 
x

x
He  
x

x
managed  
x

x
by  
x

x
leaning  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
to  
x

x
cut  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
strong  
x

x
sticky  
x

x
threads  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
bound  
x

x
him  
x

x
round,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then,  
x

x
sure  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
kick  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
struggle  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
emerged. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
actually  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
jerking  
x

x
his  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
arms  
x

x
and  
x

x
legs  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
danced  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spider-string  
x

x
under  
x

x
his  
x

x
armpits,  
x

x
just  
x

x
like  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
funny  
x

x
toys  
x

x
bobbing  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
wire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Somehow  
x

x
or  
x

x
other  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
was  
x

x
got  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
branch,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
his  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
although  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
very  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
ill  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
spider-poison,  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
next  
x

x
day  
x

x
wound  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
with  
x

x
only  
x

x
his  
x

x
nose  
x

x
to  
x

x
breathe  
x

x
through. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
him  
x

x
ages  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
beastly  
x

x
stuff  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
and  
x

x
eyebrows,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
beard,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
cut  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
off. 
x

x
Well,  
x

x
between  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
started  
x

x
to  
x

x
haul  
x

x
up  
x

x
first  
x

x
one  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
and  
x

x
slash  
x

x
them  
x

x
free. 
x

x
None  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
better  
x

x
off  
x

x
than  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
worse. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
had  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
been  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
breathe  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
(long  
x

x
noses  
x

x
are  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
useful  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
see)  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
more  
x

x
poisoned. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
rescued  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
  
x

x
Dori  
x

x
and  
x

x
Nori. 
x

x
Poor  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
exhausted  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
fattest  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
constantly  
x

x
pinched  
x

x
and  
x

x
poked  
x

x
—  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
plop  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
fortunately  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
lay  
x

x
there. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
five  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
back,  
x

x
more  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
rage  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
branch  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree-trunk  
x

x
and  
x

x
kept  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
crawled  
x

x
up. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
taken  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
rescued  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
to  
x

x
put  
x

x
it  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
so  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
splutter  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hiss:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
we  
x

x
see  
x

x
you,  
x

x
you  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
little  
x

x
creature!  
x

x
  
x

x
We  
x

x
will  
x

x
eat  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
leave  
x

x
your  
x

x
bones  
x

x
and  
x

x
skin  
x

x
  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
Ugh!  
x

x
he’s  
x

x
got  
x

x
a  
x

x
sting  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
he?  
x

x
Well,  
x

x
we’ll  
x

x
get  
x

x
him  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
we’ll  
x

x
hang  
x

x
him  
x

x
head  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
day  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
two.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
While  
x

x
this  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
on,  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
working  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
captives,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cutting  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
threads  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
knives. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
free,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
clear  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
happen  
x

x
after  
x

x
that. 
x

x
The  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
them  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
easily  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
unawares  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
there  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like  
x

x
being  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
battle. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
had  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
round  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
tied  
x

x
him  
x

x
up  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
dragging  
x

x
him  
x

x
away. 
x

x
He  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
shout  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
slashed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
gave  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
tree  
x

x
right  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
His  
x

x
little  
x

x
sword  
x

x
was  
x

x
something  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
stings  
x

x
for  
x

x
them. 
x

x
How  
x

x
it  
x

x
darted  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fro!  
x

x
It  
x

x
shone  
x

x
with  
x

x
delight  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
stabbed  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Half  
x

x
a  
x

x
dozen  
x

x
were  
x

x
killed  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
  
x

x
drew  
x

x
off  
x

x
and  
x

x
left  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
down!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
down!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
branch. 
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
stay  
x

x
up  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
be  
x

x
netted!”  
x

x
For  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
swarming  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
neighbouring  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
boughs  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
heads  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
or  
x

x
jumped  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
dropped,  
x

x
eleven  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
heap,  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
shaky  
x

x
and  
x

x
little  
x

x
use  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
legs. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
counting  
x

x
poor  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
being  
x

x
propped  
x

x
up  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
  
x

x
side  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
cousin  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
brother  
x

x
Bofur;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
about  
x

x
and  
x

x
waving  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
Sting;  
x

x
and  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
angry  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
goggling  
x

x
at  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
about  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
above. 
x

x
It  
x

x
looked  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
hopeless. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
began. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
knives,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
had  
x

x
sticks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
at  
x

x
stones;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
dagger. 
x

x
Again  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
beaten  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
killed. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
long. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
  
x

x
tired  
x

x
out;  
x

x
only  
x

x
four  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
stand  
x

x
firmly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
all  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
overpowered  
x

x
like  
x

x
weary  
x

x
flies. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
weave  
x

x
their  
x

x
webs  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
them  
x

x
again  
x

x
from  
x

x
tree  
x

x
to  
x

x
tree. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
no  
x

x
plan  
x

x
  
x

x
except  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
rather  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
about  
x

x
it,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
helped. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
disappear,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
draw  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
off,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
can;  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
must  
x

x
keep  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
and  
x

x
make  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
opposite  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
To  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
there,  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
we  
x

x
last  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-  
x

x
  
x

x
fires.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
understand,  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
dizzy  
x

x
heads,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shouts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
whacking  
x

x
of  
x

x
sticks  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
throwing  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
stones;  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
delay  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
longer  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
their  
x

x
circle  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
closer. 
x

x
He  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
astonishment  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
vanished. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
“Lazy  
x

x
Lob”  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
“Attercop”  
x

x
from  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
away  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
right. 
x

x
That  
x

x
upset  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
greatly. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
advancing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
went  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
direction  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“Attercop”  
x

x
made  
x

x
them  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
angry  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
lost  
x

x
their  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
grasped  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
plan  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest,  
x

x
  
x

x
led  
x

x
an  
x

x
attack. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
together  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
knot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sending  
x

x
a  
x

x
shower  
x

x
of  
x

x
stones  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
drove  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
left,  
x

x
and  
x

x
burst  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
Away  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
and  
x

x
singing  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
stopped. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Hoping  
x

x
desperately  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
went  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
fast  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
  
x

x
though. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
weary,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
much  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobble  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
wobble,  
x

x
though  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
close  
x

x
  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
Every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fight  
x

x
the  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
overtaking  
x

x
them;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
already  
x

x
some  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
above  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
throwing  
x

x
down  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
clinging  
x

x
threads. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Things  
x

x
were  
x

x
looking  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
bad  
x

x
again,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
reappeared,  
x

x
and  
x

x
charged  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
astonished  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
unexpectedly  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
side. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Go  
x

x
on!  
x

x
Go  
x

x
on!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
do  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stinging!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
he  
x

x
did. 
x

x
He  
x

x
darted  
x

x
backwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
forwards,  
x

x
slashing  
x

x
at  
x

x
spider-threads,  
x

x
hacking  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stabbing  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
fat  
x

x
bodies  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
too  
x

x
near. 
x

x
The  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
swelled  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
rage,  
x

x
and  
x

x
spluttered  
x

x
and  
x

x
frothed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hissed  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
curses;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
become  
x

x
  
x

x
mortally  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
of  
x

x
Sting,  
x

x
and  
x

x
dared  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
near,  
x

x
now  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
back. 
x

x
So  
x

x
curse  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
would,  
x

x
their  
x

x
prey  
x

x
moved  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
away. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
business,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
hours. 
x

x
But  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
just  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
lift  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
single  
x

x
stroke  
x

x
more,  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
gave  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
followed  
x

x
them  
x

x
no  
x

x
more,  
x

x
but  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
disappointed  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
dark  
x

x
colony. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
then  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring  
x

x
where  
x

x
elf-fires  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
been. 
x

x
Whether  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
seen  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
before,  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
tell. 
x

x
But  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
that  
x

x
some  
x

x
good  
x

x
magic  
x

x
lingered  
x

x
in  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
spots,  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like. 
x

x
At  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
was  
x

x
greener,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
boughs  
x

x
less  
x

x
  
x

x
thick  
x

x
and  
x

x
threatening,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
rest  
x

x
and  
x

x
draw  
x

x
breath. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time,  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
panting. 
x

x
But  
x

x
very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
  
x

x
questions. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
  
x

x
vanishing  
x

x
business  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
explained,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
finding  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
interested  
x

x
them  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
troubles. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
particular  
x

x
insisted  
x

x
on  
x

x
having  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gollum  
x

x
story,  
x

x
  
x

x
riddles  
x

x
and  
x

x
all,  
x

x
told  
x

x
all  
x

x
over  
x

x
again,  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
proper  
x

x
place. 
x

x
But  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
fail,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
other  
x

x
questions  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
Where  
x

x
were  
x

x
they,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
path,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
any  
x

x
food,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
they  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
next?  
x

x
These  
x

x
questions  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
asked  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
expect  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
answers. 
x

x
From  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
changed  
x

x
their  
x

x
opinion  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
much,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
respect  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
(as  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
said  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
would). 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
they  
x

x
really  
x

x
expected  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
wonderful  
x

x
plan  
x

x
for  
x

x
helping  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
merely  
x

x
grumbling. 
x

x
They  
x

x
knew  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
soon  
x

x
all  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
thanked  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
many  
x

x
times. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
even  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bowed  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
before  
x

x
him,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
fell  
x

x
over  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
effort,  
x

x
and  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
legs  
x

x
again  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Knowing  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
truth  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
vanishing  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
lessen  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
opinion  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
at  
x

x
all;  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
wits,  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
luck  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
magic  
x

x
ring  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
three  
x

x
are  
x

x
very  
x

x
useful  
x

x
possessions. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
praised  
x

x
him  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
feel  
x

x
there  
x

x
really  
x

x
was  
x

x
something  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
bold  
x

x
  
x

x
adventurer  
x

x
about  
x

x
himself  
x

x
after  
x

x
all,  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
felt  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
bolder  
x

x
still,  
x

x
if  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
anything  
x

x
to  
x

x
eat. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
at  
x

x
all;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
fit  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
anything,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
search  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
lost  
x

x
path. 
x

x
The  
x

x
lost  
x

x
  
x

x
path!  
x

x
No  
x

x
other  
x

x
idea  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
  
x

x
tired  
x

x
head. 
x

x
He  
x

x
just  
x

x
sat  
x

x
staring  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
endless  
x

x
trees;  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
silent  
x

x
again. 
x

x
All  
x

x
except  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
Long  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
had  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
talking  
x

x
and  
x

x
shut  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
kept  
x

x
on  
x

x
muttering  
x

x
and  
x

x
chuckling  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Gollum!  
x

x
Well  
x

x
I’m  
x

x
blest!  
x

x
So  
x

x
that’s  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
sneaked  
x

x
past  
x

x
me,  
x

x
is  
x

x
it?  
x

x
Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
know!  
x

x
Just  
x

x
crept  
x

x
  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
along  
x

x
did  
x

x
you,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins?  
x

x
Buttons  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorstep!  
x

x
Good  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
—  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
—  
x

x
bo  
x

x
—  
x

x
bo  
x

x
—  
x

x
bo  
x

x
—  
x

x
”  
x

x
And  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
complete  
x

x
silence  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
opened  
x

x
an  
x

x
eye,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
round  
x

x
at  
x

x
them. 
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
Thorin?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
asked. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
shock. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
Where  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
was  
x

x
Thorin?  
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
what  
x

x
evil  
x

x
fate  
x

x
had  
x

x
befallen  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
or  
x

x
dark  
x

x
monsters;  
x

x
and  
x

x
shuddered  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
lost  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
into  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
dreams,  
x

x
as  
x

x
evening  
x

x
wore  
x

x
to  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
night;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
we  
x

x
must  
x

x
leave  
x

x
them  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
present,  
x

x
too  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
weary  
x

x
to  
x

x
set  
x

x
guards  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
take  
x

x
turns  
x

x
at  
x

x
watching. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
caught  
x

x
much  
x

x
faster  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had. 
x

x
You  
x

x
remember  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
falling  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
log  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
sleep,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
circle  
x

x
of  
x

x
light?  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
time  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
who  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
  
x

x
forward,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
lights  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stone  
x

x
enchanted. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
lost  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
night,  
x

x
their  
x

x
cries  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
bound  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sounds  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
next  
x

x
day,  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
unheard. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bound  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
carried  
x

x
him  
x

x
away. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
feasting  
x

x
people  
x

x
were  
x

x
Wood-elves,  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course. 
x

x
These  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
folk. 
x

x
If  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
fault  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
distrust  
x

x
of  
x

x
strangers. 
x

x
Though  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
magic

x
was  
x

x
strong,  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
wary. 
x

x
They  
x

x
differed  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
High  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
West,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
more  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
and  
x

x
less  
x

x
wise. 
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
(together  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
  
x

x
relations  
x

x
in  
x

x
the

hills  
x

and

mountains)  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
descended  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
tribes  
x

x
that  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
Faerie  
x

in

the

West. 
x

x
There  
x

x
the  
x

Light-  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the

x
Deep-elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Sea-elves  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
and  
x

x
lived  
x

x
for  
x

x
ages,  
x

x
and  
x

x
grew  
x

x
fairer  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wiser  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
learned,  
x

x
and  
x

x
invented  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
craft  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
making  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
beautiful  
x

and

marvellous  
x

x
things,

x
before

some  
x

x

came  
x

x
back  
x

x
into

x
the

Wide

World. 
x

x
In

the  
x

x
Wide  
x

x
  
x

x
World  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
lingered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the

twilight

of  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

x
Sun  
x

and  
x

x
Moon,  
x

x
but  
x

x
loved  
x

x
best  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
forests  
x

x
that  
x

x
grew  
x

x
tall  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
lands  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
now  
x

x
lost. 
x

x
They  
x

x
dwelt  
x

x
most  
x

x
often  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
edges  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

x
woods,  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
escape  
x

x
at  
x

x
times  
x

x
to  
x

x
hunt,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
ride

and

run

over

the

open

lands

by  
x

x
moonlight  
x

x
or

starlight;  
x

x

and  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
coming  
x

x
of  
x

x
Men  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

gloaming

the

dusk. 
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
elves  
x

x
they  
x

x
were

and

remain,  
x

x
and

that

is  
x

x
  
x

x
Good  
x

x
People. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
cave  
x

x
some  
x

x
miles  
x

x
within  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
side  
x

x
there  
x

x
lived  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
their  
x

x
greatest  
x

x
king. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
his  
x

x
huge  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
ran  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
heights  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
and  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
feet  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
high  
x

x
wooded  
x

x
lands. 
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
great  
x

x
cave,  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
countless  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
  
x

x
ones  
x

x
opened  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
every  
x

x
side,  
x

x
wound  
x

x
far  
x

x
  
x

x
underground  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
many  
x

x
passages  
x

x
and  
x

x
wide  
x

x
  
x

x
halls;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
lighter  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
wholesome  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
any  
x

x
goblin-dwelling,  
x

x
and  
x

x
neither  
x

x
so  
x

x
deep  
x

x
  
x

x
nor  
x

x
so  
x

x
dangerous. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
the  
x

x
subjects  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
king  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
lived  
x

x
and  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
open  
x

x
woods,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
houses  
x

x
or  
x

x
huts  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
branches. 
x

x
The  
x

x
beeches  
x

x
were  
x

x
their  
x

x
favourite  
x

x
  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
The  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
cave  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
palace,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
strong  
x

x
place  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
treasure,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
fortress  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
people  
x

x
against  
x

x
their  
x

x
enemies. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
also  
x

x
the  
x

x
dungeon  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
prisoners. 
x

x
So  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
cave  
x

x
they  
x

x
dragged  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
too  
x

x
gently,  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
love  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
enemy. 
x

x
In  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
days  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
wars  
x

x
with  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
whom  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
accused  
x

x
of  
x

x
stealing  
x

x
their  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
only  
x

x
fair  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
account,  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
only  
x

x
took  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
due,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-king  
x

x
had  
x

x
bargained  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
shape  
x

x
his  
x

x
raw  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
refused  
x

x
to  
x

x
give  
x

x
them  
x

x
their  
x

x
pay. 
x

x
If  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elf-king  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
weakness  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
for  
x

x
treasure,  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
for  
x

x
silver  
x

x
and  
x

x
white  
x

x
gems;  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
was  
x

x
rich,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
ever  
x

x
eager  
x

x
for  
x

x
more,  
x

x
  
x

x
since  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
as  
x

x
great  
x

x
a  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
elf-lords  
x

x
of  
x

x
old. 
x

x
His  
x

x
people  
x

x
neither  
x

x
mined  
x

x
  
x

x
nor  
x

x
worked  
x

x
metals  
x

x
or  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
did  
x

x
they  
x

x
bother  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
with  
x

x
trade  
x

x
or  
x

x
with  
x

x
tilling  
x

x
the  
x

x
earth. 
x

x
All  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
well  
x

x
known  
x

x
to  
x

x
every  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
though  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
  
x

x
family  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
quarrel  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
of. 
x

x
Consequently  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
angry  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
treatment  
x

x
of  
x

x
him,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
spell  
x

x
off  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
senses;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
determined  
x

x
that  
x

x
no  
x

x
word  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
gold  
x

x
or  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
should  
x

x
be  
x

x
dragged  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
king  
x

x
looked  
x

x
sternly  
x

x
on  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
brought  
x

x
before  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
asked  
x

x
him  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
questions. 
x

x
But  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
would  
x

x
only  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
starving. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why  
x

x
did  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
folk  
x

x
three  
x

x
times  
x

x
try  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
attack  
x

x
my  
x

x
people  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
merrymaking?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
king. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
attack  
x

x
them,”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
  
x

x
“we  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
beg,  
x

x
because  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
starving.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
are  
x

x
your  
x

x
friends  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
doing?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
starving  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
were  
x

x
you  
x

x
doing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
food  
x

x
and  
x

x
drink,  
x

x
because  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
starving.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
what  
x

x
brought  
x

x
you  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
at  
x

x
all?”  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
angrily. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
say  
x

x
another  
x

x
word. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
king. 
x

x
“Take  
x

x
him  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
keep  
x

x
him  
x

x
safe,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
feels  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
waits  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
years.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
put  
x

x
thongs  
x

x
on  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
shut  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
inmost  
x

x
caves  
x

x
with  
x

x
strong  
x

x
  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
doors,  
x

x
and  
x

x
left  
x

x
him. 
x

x
They  
x

x
gave  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
food  
x

x
and  
x

x
drink,  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
of  
x

x
both,  
x

x
if  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
fine;  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
goblins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
reasonably  
x

x
well-behaved  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
worst  
x

x
  
x

x
enemies,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
captured  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
giant  
x

x
  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
living  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
mercy  
x

x
upon. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
dungeon  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
lay;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
thankfulness  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
bread  
x

x
and  
x

x
meat  
x

x
and  
x

x
water,  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
become  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
unfortunate  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
discovered;  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
belongs  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
next  
x

x
 
x

x
chapter  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
another  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
showed  
x

x
his  
x

x
usefulness.

Chapter

BARRELS  
x

x
OUT  
x

x
OF  
x

x
BOND  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
day  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
made  
x

x
one  
x

x
last  
x

x
despairing  
x

x
  
x

x
effort  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
a  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
died  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
hunger  
x

x
and  
x

x
thirst. 
x

x
They  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
staggered  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
direction  
x

x
which  
x

x
eight  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
path  
x

x
  
x

x
lay;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
never  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
right. 
x

x
  
x

x
Such  
x

x
day  
x

x
as  
x

x
there  
x

x
ever  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
fading  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
blackness  
x

x
of  
x

x
night,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
out  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
torches  
x

x
all  
x

x
round  
x

x
them,  
x

x
like  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
red  
x

x
  
x

x
stars. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
bows  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
spears  
x

x
and  
x

x
called  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
to  
x

x
halt. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
fight. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
in  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
state  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
actually  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
captured,  
x

x
their  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
knives,  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
weapons  
x

x
they  
x

x
had,  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
of  
x

x
no  
x

x
use  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
could  
x

x
hit  
x

x
a  
x

x
bird's  
x

x
eye  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
simply  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
dead  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
waited  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
all  
x

x
except  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
popped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
side. 
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
why,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
bound  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
line,  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
other,  
x

x
and  
x

x
counted  
x

x
them,  
x

x
they  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
found  
x

x
or  
x

x
counted  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Nor  
x

x
did  
x

x
they  
x

x
hear  
x

x
or  
x

x
feel  
x

x
him  
x

x
trotting  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
behind  
x

x
their  
x

x
torch-light  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
led  
x

x
off  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
Each  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
blindfold,  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
make  
x

x
much  
x

x
difference,  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
even  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
use  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
going,  
x

x
and  
x

x
neither  
x

x
he  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
knew  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
started  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
anyway. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
torches,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
making  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
go  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
they  
x

x
could,  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
weary  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
were. 
x

x
The  
x

x
king  
x

x
had  
x

x
ordered  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
haste. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
torches  
x

x
stopped,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
had  
x

x
just  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
catch  
x

x
them  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge. 
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
that  
x

x
led  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
  
x

x
doors. 
x

x
The  
x

x
water  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
swift  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
strong  
x

x
beneath;  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
end  
x

x
were  
x

x
gates  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
huge  
x

x
cave  
x

x
that  
x

x
ran  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
steep  
x

x
slope  
x

x
covered  
x

x
with  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
beeches  
x

x
came  
x

x
right  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
till  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Across  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
hesitated  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rear. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
look  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cavern-mouth,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
only  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
desert  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
friends  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
scuttle  
x

x
over  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
heels  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
elves,  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
gates  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
closed  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
clang. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
passages  
x

x
were  
x

x
lit  
x

x
with  
x

x
red  
x

x
torch-  
x

x
  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-guards  
x

x
sang  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
marched  
x

x
  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
twisting,  
x

x
crossing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
echoing  
x

x
paths. 
x

x
  
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
those  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin-cities;  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
smaller,  
x

x
less  
x

x
deep  
x

x
underground,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
cleaner  
x

x
air. 
x

x
In  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
hall  
x

x
with  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
  
x

x
hewn  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
living  
x

x
stone  
x

x
sat  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
chair  
x

x
of  
x

x
carven  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
On  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
crown  
x

x
of  
x

x
berries  
x

x
and  
x

x
red  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
come  
x

x
again. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
spring  
x

x
he  
x

x
wore  
x

x
a  
x

x
crown  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
woodland  
x

x
flowers. 
x

x
In  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
he  
x

x
held  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
carven  
x

x
staff  
x

x
of  
x

x
oak. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Elvenking's  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
were  
x

x
brought  
x

x
before  
x

x
him;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
grimly  
x

x
at  
x

x
them,  
x

x
he  
x

x
told  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
to  
x

x
unbind  
x

x
them,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
ragged  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
weary. 
x

x
“Besides  
x

x
they  
x

x
need  
x

x
no  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
in  
x

x
here,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
my  
x

x
magic  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
for  
x

x
those  
x

x
who  
x

x
are  
x

x
once  
x

x
brought  
x

x
inside.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Long  
x

x
and  
x

x
searchingly  
x

x
he  
x

x
questioned  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
about  
x

x
their  
x

x
doings,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
going  
x

x
to,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
coming  
x

x
  
x

x
from;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
little  
x

x
more  
x

x
news  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
surly  
x

x
and  
x

x
angry  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
polite. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
have  
x

x
we  
x

x
done,  
x

x
O  
x

x
king?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
eldest  
x

x
left. 
x

x
“Is  
x

x
it  
x

x
a  
x

x
crime  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
lost  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
and  
x

x
thirsty,  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
trapped  
x

x
by  
x

x
spiders?  
x

x
Are  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
your  
x

x
tame  
x

x
  
x

x
beasts  
x

x
or  
x

x
your  
x

x
pets,  
x

x
if  
x

x
killing  
x

x
them  
x

x
makes  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
angry?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Such  
x

x
a  
x

x
question  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
  
x

x
angrier  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
answered:  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
crime  
x

x
to  
x

x
wander  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
realm  
x

x
without  
x

x
leave. 
x

x
Do  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
forget  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
kingdom,  
x

x
using  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
that  
x

x
my  
x

x
people  
x

x
made?  
x

x
Did  
x

x
you  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
three  
x

x
times  
x

x
pursue  
x

x
and  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
my  
x

x
people  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
forest  
x

x
and  
x

x
rouse  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders  
x

x
with  
x

x
your  
x

x
riot  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
clamour?  
x

x
After  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
disturbance  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
brings  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
here,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
tell  
x

x
me  
x

x
now,  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
keep  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
prison  
x

x
until  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
learned  
x

x
sense  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
manners!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
ordered  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
each  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
put  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
separate  
x

x
cell  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
given  
x

x
food  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drink,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
allowed  
x

x
to  
x

x
pass  
x

x
the  
x

x
doors  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
little  
x

x
prisons,  
x

x
until  
x

x
one  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
him  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
know. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
tell  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
also  
x

x
a  
x

x
prisoner  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
who  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
out. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Poor  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
weary  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
lived  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
place  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
hiding,  
x

x
never  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
daring  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep,  
x

x
even  
x

x
tucked  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
darkest  
x

x
and  
x

x
remotest  
x

x
corners  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
find. 
x

x
For  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
to  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Elvenking's  
x

x
palace. 
x

x
Magic  
x

x
shut  
x

x
the  
x

x
gates,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
get  
x

x
out,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
quick. 
x

x
  
x

x
Companies  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves,  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
head,  
x

x
would  
x

x
from  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
ride  
x

x
out  
x

x
to  
x

x
hunt,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
other  
x

x
business  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
woods  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
East. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
nimble,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
slip  
x

x
out  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them;  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
thing  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
do. 
x

x
More  
x

x
than  
x

x
once  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
caught  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
doors,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
clashed  
x

x
together  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
elf  
x

x
passed;  
x

x
yet  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
march  
x

x
among  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
(altogether  
x

x
thin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wobbly  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
torchlight),  
x

x
or  
x

x
for  
x

x
fear  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
being  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
into  
x

x
and  
x

x
discovered. 
x

x
And  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
go  
x

x
out,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
very  
x

x
often,  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
good. 
x

x
Fie  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to  
x

x
desert  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
where  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
without  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
keep  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
elves  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
out,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
never  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
the  
x

x
ways  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
left  
x

x
to  
x

x
wander  
x

x
miserably  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
  
x

x
terrified  
x

x
of  
x

x
losing  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
until  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
returning. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
too  
x

x
outside,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
hunter;  
x

x
but  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
caves  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
pick  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
living  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
sort  
x

x
by  
x

x
stealing  
x

x
food  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
store  
x

x
or  
x

x
table  
x

x
when  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
that  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
get  
x

x
away,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
miserably  
x

x
burgling  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
house  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
after  
x

x
day,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreariest  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
dullest  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
wretched,  
x

x
tiresome,  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
adventure!  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
warm  
x

x
fireside  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lamp  
x

x
shining!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
often  
x

x
wished,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
a  
x

x
message  
x

x
for  
x

x
help  
x

x
sent  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
impossible;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
realized  
x

x
that  
x

x
if  
x

x
anything  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done  
x

x
by  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
alone  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
unaided. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Eventually,  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
week  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
sneaking  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
life,  
x

x
by  
x

x
watching  
x

x
and  
x

x
following  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards  
x

x
and  
x

x
taking  
x

x
what  
x

x
chances  
x

x
he  
x

x
could,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
out  
x

x
where  
x

x
each  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
kept. 
x

x
He  
x

x
found  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
cells  
x

x
in  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
parts  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
palace,  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
his  
x

x
way  
x

x
about  
x

x
very  
x

x
well. 
x

x
What  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
to  
x

x
overhear  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
guards  
x

x
talking  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
learn  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
in  
x

x
prison  
x

x
too,  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
specially  
x

x
deep  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
place. 
x

x
He  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
and  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
guess  
x

x
was  
x

x
right. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
after  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
difficulties  
x

x
he  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
word  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
chief  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
angry  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
longer  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
misfortunes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
telling  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
quest  
x

x
(which  
x

x
shows  
x

x
how  
x

x
low-  
x

x
  
x

x
spirited  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
become),  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
little  
x

x
voice  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
keyhole. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
believe  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
however  
x

x
he  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
mistaken,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
  
x

x
talk  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
  
x

x
secretly  
x

x
Thorin's  
x

x
message  
x

x
to  
x

x
each  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
imprisoned  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
telling  
x

x
them  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
chief  
x

x
was  
x

x
also  
x

x
in  
x

x
prison  
x

x
close  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
reveal  
x

x
their  
x

x
errand  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
king,  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
before  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
gave  
x

x
the  
x

x
word. 
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
taken  
x

x
heart  
x

x
again  
x

x
hearing  
x

x
how  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
had  
x

x
rescued  
x

x
his  
x

x
companions  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
spiders,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
determined  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
ransom  
x

x
himself  
x

x
with  
x

x
promises  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
share  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure,  
x

x
until  
x

x
all  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
escaping  
x

x
in  
x

x
any  
x

x
other  
x

x
way  
x

x
had  
x

x
disappeared;  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
the  
x

x
remarkable  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Invisible  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
  
x

x
(of  
x

x
whom  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
high  
x

x
opinion  
x

x
  
x

x
indeed)  
x

x
had  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
failed  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
clever. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
other  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
quite  
x

x
agreed  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
the  
x

x
message. 
x

x
They  
x

x
all  
x

x
thought  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
shares  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
(which  
x

x
they  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
regarded  
x

x
as  
x

x
theirs,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
plight  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
still  
x

x
unconquered  
x

x
dragon)  
x

x
would  
x

x
suffer  
x

x
  
x

x
seriously  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
claimed  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
trusted  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
what  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
would  
x

x
happen,  
x

x
you  
x

x
see. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
reason  
x

x
for  
x

x
going  
x

x
off  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
feel  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
hopeful  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
did. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
depended  
x

x
on  
x

x
by  
x

x
everyone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
But  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
use:  
x

x
  
x

x
probably  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
distance  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
lay  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
sat  
x

x
and  
x

x
thought  
x

x
and  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
burst,  
x

x
but  
x

x
no  
x

x
bright  
x

x
idea  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
come. 
x

x
One  
x

x
invisible  
x

x
ring  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
fine  
x

x
  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
good  
x

x
among  
x

x
fourteen. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
guessed,  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
rescue  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end,  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
how  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
happened. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
One  
x

x
day,  
x

x
nosing  
x

x
and  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
about,  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
interesting  
x

x
thing:  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
gates  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
caves. 
x

x
A  
x

x
stream  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
under  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lowest  
x

x
  
x

x
regions  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
palace,  
x

x
and  
x

x
joined  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
  
x

x
River  
x

x
some  
x

x
way  
x

x
further  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
east,  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
steep  
x

x
slope  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
  
x

x
opened. 
x

x
Where  
x

x
this  
x

x
underground  
x

x
watercourse  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
forth  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hillside  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
water-  
x

x
  
x

x
gate. 
x

x
There  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
roof  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
surface  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream,  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
it  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
portcullis  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
bed  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
prevent  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
coming  
x

x
in  
x

x
or  
x

x
out  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
way. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
portcullis  
x

x
was  
x

x
often  
x

x
open,  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
traffic  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
water-  
x

x
  
x

x
gate. 
x

x
If  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
way,  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
found  
x

x
himself  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
rough  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
  
x

x
leading  
x

x
deep  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill;  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
point  
x

x
where  
x

x
it  
x

x
passed  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
caves  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
cut  
x

x
away  
x

x
and  
x

x
covered  
x

x
with  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
oaken  
x

x
trapdoors. 
x

x
These  
x

x
opened  
x

x
upwards  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
cellars. 
x

x
There  
x

x
stood  
x

x
barrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
barrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
barrels;  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
their  
x

x
king,  
x

x
were  
x

x
very  
x

x
fond  
x

x
of  
x

x
wine,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
no  
x

x
vines  
x

x
grew  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
parts. 
x

x
The  
x

x
wine,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
goods,  
x

x
were  
x

x
brought  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
away,  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
kinsfolk  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
South,  
x

x
or  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
vineyards  
x

x
of  
x

x
Men  
x

x
in  
x

x
distant  
x

x
lands. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Hiding  
x

x
behind  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
largest  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
the  
x

x
trapdoors  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
use,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
lurking  
x

x
there,  
x

x
listening  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
talk  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
king's  
x

x
servants,  
x

x
he  
x

x
learned  
x

x
how  
x

x
the  
x

x
wine  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
goods  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
rivers,  
x

x
or  
x

x
over  
x

x
land,  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
a  
x

x
town  
x

x
of  
x

x
Men  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
throve  
x

x
there,  
x

x
built  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
bridges  
x

x
far  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
protection  
x

x
against  
x

x
enemies  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
sorts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
especially  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
From  
x

x
Lake-town  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River. 
x

x
Often  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
tied  
x

x
together  
x

x
like  
x

x
big  
x

x
rafts  
x

x
and  
x

x
poled  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
rowed  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream;  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
loaded  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
flat  
x

x
boats. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
were  
x

x
empty  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
cast  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
trapdoors,  
x

x
opened  
x

x
the  
x

x
water-  
x

x
  
x

x
gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
floated  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream,  
x

x
  
x

x
bobbing  
x

x
along,  
x

x
until  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
carried  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
current  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
far  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bank  
x

x
jutted  
x

x
out,  
x

x
near  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
collected  
x

x
and  
x

x
tied  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
and  
x

x
floated  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
Lake-town,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
stood  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
point  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

x
and  
x

x
thought  
x

x
about  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
water-gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
used  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
escape  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
beginnings  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
plan. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
evening  
x

x
meal  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
taken  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
prisoners. 
x

x
The  
x

x
guards  
x

x
were  
x

x
tramping  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
passages  
x

x
taking  
x

x
the  
x

x
torchlight  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
everything  
x

x
in  
x

x
darkness. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
king's  
x

x
butler  
x

x
bidding  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards  
x

x
good-night. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
come  
x

x
with  
x

x
me,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
taste  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
new  
x

x
wine  
x

x
that  
x

x
has  
x

x
just  
x

x
come  
x

x
in. 
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
hard  
x

x
at  
x

x
work  
x

x
tonight  
x

x
clearing  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellars  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
empty  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
so  
x

x
let  
x

x
us  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
labour.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
good,”  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
guards. 
x

x
“I’ll  
x

x
taste  
x

x
with  
x

x
you,  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
fit  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
table. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
feast  
x

x
tonight  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
send  
x

x
up  
x

x
poor  
x

x
stuff!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
this  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
flutter,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
luck  
x

x
was  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
chance  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
to  
x

x
try  
x

x
his  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
plan. 
x

x
Fie  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
the  
x

x
two  
x

x
elves,  
x

x
until  
x

x
they  
x

x
entered  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
cellar  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
table  
x

x
on  
x

x
which  
x

x
two  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
large  
x

x
flagons  
x

x
were  
x

x
set. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
drink  
x

x
and  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
merrily. 
x

x
Luck  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
unusual  
x

x
kind  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
with  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
then. 
x

x
It  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
potent  
x

x
wine  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
wood-elf  
x

x
drowsy;  
x

x
but  
x

x
this  
x

x
wine,  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
seem,  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
heady  
x

x
vintage  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
gardens  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dorwinion,  
x

x
not  
x

x
meant  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
soldiers  
x

x
or  
x

x
his  
x

x
servants,  
x

x
but  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
king's  
x

x
feasts  
x

x
  
x

x
only,  
x

x
and  
x

x
for  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
bowls  
x

x
not  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler’s  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
flagons. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
guard  
x

x
nodded  
x

x
his  
x

x
head,  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
laid  
x

x
it  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
table  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
butler  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
talking  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
without  
x

x
seeming  
x

x
to  
x

x
notice,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
soon  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
too  
x

x
nodded  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
table,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
and  
x

x
snored  
x

x
beside  
x

x
his  
x

x
friend. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
in  
x

x
crept  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
  
x

x
guard  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
keys,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
trotting  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
passages  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
cells. 
x

x
The  
x

x
great  
x

x
bunch  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
very  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
was  
x

x
often  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
mouth,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
prevent  
x

x
the  
x

x
keys  
x

x
from  
x

x
making  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
clink  
x

x
and  
x

x
clank,  
x

x
which  
x

x
put  
x

x
him  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
tremble. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
First  
x

x
he  
x

x
unlocked  
x

x
Balin’s  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
locked  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
outside. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
surprised,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
imagine;  
x

x
but  
x

x
glad  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
wearisome  
x

x
little  
x

x
stone  
x

x
room,  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
stop  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
ask  
x

x
questions,  
x

x
and  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
do,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
time  
x

x
now!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
follow  
x

x
me!  
x

x
We  
x

x
must  
x

x
all  
x

x
keep  
x

x
together  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
risk  
x

x
getting  
x

x
separated. 
x

x
All  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
must  
x

x
escape  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
none,  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
our  
x

x
last  
x

x
chance. 
x

x
If  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
out,  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
knows  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
will  
x

x
put  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
next,  
x

x
with  
x

x
chains  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
hands  
x

x
and  
x

x
feet  
x

x
too,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
expect. 
x

x
Don't  
x

x
argue,  
x

x
there’s  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
fellow!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
off  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
from  
x

x
door  
x

x
to  
x

x
door,  
x

x
until  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
following  
x

x
had  
x

x
grown  
x

x
to  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
—  
x

x
none  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
too  
x

x
nimble,  
x

x
what  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
imprisonment. 
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
heart  
x

x
  
x

x
thumped  
x

x
every  
x

x
time  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
bumped  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
another,  
x

x
or  
x

x
grunted  
x

x
or  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Drat  
x

x
this  
x

x
dwarvish  
x

x
racket!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

x
well,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
met  
x

x
no  
x

x
guards. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
feast  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods  
x

x
that  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
halls  
x

x
above. 
x

x
  
x

x
Nearly  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
folk  
x

x
were  
x

x
merrymaking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
after  
x

x
much  
x

x
blundering  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
dungeon,  
x

x
far  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
place  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fortunately  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellars. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Upon  
x

x
my  
x

x
word!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
join  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
friends,  
x

x
“Gandalf  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
true,  
x

x
as  
x

x
usual!  
x

x
A  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
  
x

x
fine  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
you  
x

x
make,  
x

x
it  
x

x
seems,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
comes. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
all  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
service,  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
happens  
x

x
after  
x

x
this. 
x

x
But  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
comes  
x

x
next?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
explain  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
idea,  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
feel  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
sure  
x

x
how  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
would  
x

x
take  
x

x
it. 
x

x
His  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
fears  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
justified,  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit,  
x

x
and  
x

x
started  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
loudly  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
danger. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
bruised  
x

x
and  
x

x
battered  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
pieces,  
x

x
and  
x

x
drowned  
x

x
too,  
x

x
for  
x

x
certain!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
muttered. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
thought  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
got  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
sensible  
x

x
notion,  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
hold  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
keys. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
mad  
x

x
idea!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
very  
x

x
downcast,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
rather  
x

x
annoyed. 
x

x
“Come  
x

x
along  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
nice  
x

x
cells,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
lock  
x

x
you  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
sit  
x

x
there  
x

x
comfortably  
x

x
and  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
better  
x

x
plan  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
don't  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
ever  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
keys  
x

x
again,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
try.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
much  
x

x
for  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
calmed  
x

x
down. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
do  
x

x
just  
x

x
what  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
suggested,  
x

x
because  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
obviously  
x

x
impossible  
x

x
for  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
try  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
way  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
upper  
x

x
halls,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
fight  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
gates  
x

x
that  
x

x
closed  
x

x
by  
x

x
magic;  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
passages  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
caught  
x

x
again. 
x

x
So  
x

x
following  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lowest  
x

x
cellars  
x

x
they  
x

x
crept. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
passed  
x

x
a  
x

x
door  
x

x
through  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
guard  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
still  
x

x
happily  
x

x
snoring  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
smiles  
x

x
upon  
x

x
their  
x

x
faces. 
x

x
The  
x

x
wine  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Dorwinion  
x

x
brings  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
dreams. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
different  
x

x
expression  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
face  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
guard  
x

x
next  
x

x
day,  
x

x
even  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
on,  
x

x
stole  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
kind-  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
heartedly  
x

x
put  
x

x
the  
x

x
keys  
x

x
back  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
belt. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
will  
x

x
save  
x

x
him  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
for,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
wasn’t  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
fellow,  
x

x
and  
x

x
quite  
x

x
decent  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
prisoners. 
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
will  
x

x
puzzle  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
too. 
x

x
They  
x

x
will  
x

x
think  
x

x
we  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
strong  
x

x
magic  
x

x
to  
x

x
pass  
x

x
through  
x

x
all  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
locked  
x

x
doors  
x

x
and  
x

x
disappear. 
x

x
Disappear!  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
busy  
x

x
very  
x

x
quick,  
x

x
if  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
happen!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
was  
x

x
told  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
watch  
x

x
the  
x

x
guard  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
butler  
x

x
and  
x

x
give  
x

x
warning  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
stirred. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rest  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
adjoining  
x

x
cellar  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
trapdoors. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
little  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
lose. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
long,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
some  
x

x
elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
under  
x

x
orders  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
help  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
empty  
x

x
  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
doors  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
  
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
already  
x

x
standing  
x

x
in  
x

x
rows  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
wine-barrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
use,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
easily  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
noise,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
they  
x

x
easily  
x

x
be  
x

x
secured  
x

x
again. 
x

x
But  
x

x
among  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
several  
x

x
others,  
x

x
which  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
used  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
bringing  
x

x
other  
x

x
stuffs,  
x

x
butter,  
x

x
apples,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
of  
x

x
things,  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
palace. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
soon  
x

x
found  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
with  
x

x
room  
x

x
enough  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
in  
x

x
each. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
some  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
roomy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
anxiously  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bumping  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
get  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
though  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
straw  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
stuff  
x

x
to  
x

x
pack  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
as  
x

x
cosily  
x

x
as  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
managed  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
short  
x

x
time. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
stowed. 
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
trouble,  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
tub  
x

x
and  
x

x
grumbled  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
dog  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
kennel;  
x

x
while  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
came  
x

x
last,  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
fuss  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
air-holes  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
stifling,  
x

x
even  
x

x
before  
x

x
his  
x

x
lid  
x

x
was  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
done  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
to  
x

x
close  
x

x
holes  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sides  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
fix  
x

x
on  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
lids  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
safely  
x

x
as  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
managed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
alone  
x

x
again,  
x

x
running  
x

x
round  
x

x
putting  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
finishing  
x

x
touches  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
packing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hoping  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
hope  
x

x
that  
x

x
his  
x

x
plan  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
done  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
too  
x

x
soon. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
minute  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
after  
x

x
Balin's  
x

x
lid  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
voices  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
flicker  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
lights. 
x

x
A  
x

x
number  
x

x
of  
x

x
elves  
x

x
came  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
talking  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellars  
x

x
and  
x

x
singing  
x

x
snatches  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
song. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
feast  
x

x
in  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
halls  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
bent  
x

x
on  
x

x
returning  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where’s  
x

x
old  
x

x
Galion,  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
one. 
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
haven’t  
x

x
seen  
x

x
him  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
tables  
x

x
tonight. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
here  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
show  
x

x
us  
x

x
what  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
done.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
angry  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
slowcoach  
x

x
is  
x

x
late,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
another. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to  
x

x
waste  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
here  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
song  
x

x
is  
x

x
up!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Ha,  
x

x
ha!”  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
cry. 
x

x
“Here's  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
villain  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
on  
x

x
a

x
jug!  
x

x
He's  
x

x
been  
x

x
having  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
feast  
x

x
all  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
friend  
x

x
the  
x

x
captain.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Shake  
x

x
him!  
x

x
Wake  
x

x
him!”  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
impatiently. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Galion  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
shaken  
x

x
or  
x

x
wakened,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
less  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
at. 
x

x
“You’re  
x

x
all  
x

x
late,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
grumbled. 
x

x
“Here  
x

x
  
x

x
am  
x

x
I  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
and  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
down  
x

x
here,  
x

x
while  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
fellows  
x

x
drink  
x

x
and  
x

x
make  
x

x
merry  
x

x
and  
x

x
forget  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
tasks. 
x

x
Small  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
fall  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
weariness!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Small  
x

x
wonder,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
they,  
x

x
“when  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
explanation  
x

x
stands  
x

x
close  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
jug!  
x

x
  
x

x
Come  
x

x
give  
x

x
us  
x

x
a  
x

x
taste  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
sleeping-draught  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
we  
x

x
fall  
x

x
to!  
x

x
No

need  
x

x
to  
x

x
wake  
x

x
the  
x

x
turnkey  
x

x
  
x

x
yonder. 
x

x
He  
x

x
has  
x

x
had  
x

x
his  
x

x
share  
x

by  
x

the  
x

looks  
x

x
of

it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
drank  
x

x
once  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
became  
x

x
  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
merry  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
lose  
x

x
their  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
“Save  
x

x
us,  
x

x
Galion!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
  
x

x
some,  
x

x
“you  
x

x
began  
x

x
your  
x

x
feasting

early

x

x
muddled

x
your

wits!  
x

x
You

have

stacked

some

full

here

instead

of

the

ones,

if

there

is

anything

in

weight.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Get  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
work!”  
x

x
growled  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler. 
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

is

nothing

the

feeling

of

weight

in  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

idle

toss-pot's

arms. 
x

x
These

are

the

ones

to

go

no

others.

x
Do

as

I

say!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well,  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
answered  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

to  
x

x
the

opening. 
x

x
“On

your

it,

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
pushed

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-men  
x

x
to  
x

feast

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Roll  
x

x
—  
x

x
roll  
x

—

roll

roll,

-rolling  
x

down

the

hole!  
x

x
  
x

x
Heave  
x

x
ho!  
x

x
Splash  
x

x
plump!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down  
x

x
they

go,  
x

x
down  
x

x
they  
x

x
bump!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
sang  
x

x
as  
x

x
first  
x

x
one  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
rumbled  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
opening  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
over  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
water  
x

x
some  
x

x
feet  
x

x
  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
were  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
really  
x

x
empty,  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
tubs  
x

x
neatly  
x

x
packed  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
each;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
went,  
x

x
one  
x

x
after  
x

x
another,  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
clash  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
bump,  
x

x
thudding  
x

x
on  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
ones  
x

x
  
x

x
below,  
x

x
smacking  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
jostling  
x

x
against  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel,  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
into  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
another,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bobbing  
x

x
away  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
current. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
at  
x

x
this  
x

x
moment  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
the  
x

x
weak  
x

x
point  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
plan. 
x

x
  
x

x
Most  
x

x
likely  
x

x
you  
x

x
saw  
x

x
it  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
ago  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
at  
x

x
him;  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
half  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
yourselves  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
place. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
  
x

x
nor  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
to  
x

x
pack  
x

x
him  
x

x
in,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance!  
x

x
It  
x

x
looked  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
lose  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
(nearly  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
already  
x

x
disappeared  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
trap-door),  
x

x
and  
x

x
get  
x

x
utterly  
x

x
left  
x

x
behind  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
stay  
x

x
lurking  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
permanent  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-caves  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
For  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
upper  
x

x
gates  
x

x
at  
x

x
once,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
precious  
x

x
small  
x

x
chance  
x

x
of  
x

x
ever  
x

x
finding  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
again. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
land  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
collected. 
x

x
He  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
what  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
happen  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
without  
x

x
him;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
learned,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
do,  
x

x
once  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
While  
x

x
all  
x

x
these  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
were  
x

x
passing  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
being  
x

x
very  
x

x
merry  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
a  
x

x
song  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
river-door. 
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
had  
x

x
already  
x

x
gone  
x

x
to  
x

x
haul  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
portcullis  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
water-gate  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
as  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
afloat  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down  
x

x
the  
x

x
swift  
x

x
dark  
x

x
stream  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
Back  
x

x
to  
x

x
lands  
x

x
you  
x

x
once  
x

x
did  
x

x
know/. 
x

x
  
x

x
Leave  
x

x
the  
x

x
halls  
x

x
and  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
deep,  
x

x
  
x

x
Leave  
x

x
the  
x

northern

mountains

x
steep,

x
Where

the

x

x
Stoops

in

shadow  
x

grey  
x

and  
x

x
grim!  
x

x
  
x

x
Float  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

world  
x

x
of

trees  
x

x

Out

into

Past

Up

the

Turn

Over

Where

Under

South

x
  
x

x
Down  
x

x
the

swift

dark

stream  
x

you

go  
x

x
  
x

x
Back

to  
x

x
lands  
x

x
you  
x

x
once  
x

x
did  
x

x
know/. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
last  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
was  
x

x
being  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
doors!  
x

x
In  
x

x
despair  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
what  
x

x
else  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
do,  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
caught  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
with  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell,  
x

x
splash!  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
dark  
x

x
water  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
on  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
again  
x

x
spluttering  
x

x
and  
x

x
clinging  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
rat,  
x

x
but  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
efforts  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
scramble  
x

x
on  
x

x
top. 
x

x
Every  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
tried,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
ducked  
x

x
him  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
empty,  
x

x
and  
x

x
floated  
x

x
light  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
cork. 
x

x
Though  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears  
x

x
were  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
water,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
still  
x

x
singing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cellar  
x

x
  
x

x
above. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
trap-doors  
x

x
fell  
x

x
to  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
boom  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
voices  
x

x
faded  
x

x
away. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
floating  
x

x
in  
x

x
icy  
x

x
water,  
x

x
all  
x

x
alone  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
you  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
count  
x

x
friends  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
all  
x

x
packed  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
barrels. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
a  
x

x
grey  
x

x
patch  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
ahead. 
x

x
He  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
creak  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water-gate  
x

x
being  
x

x
hauled  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
midst  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
bobbing  
x

x
and  
x

x
bumping  
x

x
  
x

x
mass  
x

x
of  
x

x
casks  
x

x
and  
x

x
tubs  
x

x
all  
x

x
pressing  
x

x
together  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
pass  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
arch  
x

x
and  
x

x
get  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
open  
x

x
  
x

x
stream. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
as  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
prevent  
x

x
himself  
x

x
from  
x

x
being  
x

x
hustled  
x

x
and  
x

x
battered  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
bits;  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
the  
x

x
jostling  
x

x
crowd  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
break  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
swing  
x

x
off,  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one,  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stony  
x

x
arch  
x

x
and  
x

x
away  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
astride  
x

x
his  
x

x
barrel,  
x

x
for  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
room  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
spare,  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
between  
x

x
its  
x

x
top  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
stooping  
x

x
roof  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
  
x

x
was. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Out  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
overhanging  
x

x
branches  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
water  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
into  
x

x
their  
x

x
tubs. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
bobbed  
x

x
along  
x

x
by  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
low  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
these  
x

x
had  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
inside. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
do  
x

x
hope  
x

x
I  
x

x
put  
x

x
the  
x

x
lids  
x

x
on  
x

x
tight  
x

x
enough!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
but  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
worrying  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
about  
x

x
himself  
x

x
to  
x

x
remember  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
managed  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
shivering  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
die  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
luck  
x

x
  
x

x
turned,  
x

x
and  
x

x
how  
x

x
much  
x

x
longer  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
able  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
hang  
x

x
on,  
x

x
and  
x

x
whether  
x

x
he  
x

x
should  
x

x
risk  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
chance  
x

x
of  
x

x
letting  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
swim  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
luck  
x

x
turned  
x

x
all  
x

x
right  
x

x
before  
x

x
long:  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
eddying  
x

x
current  
x

x
carried  
x

x
several  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
close  
x

x
  
x

x
ashore  
x

x
at  
x

x
one  
x

x
point  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
against  
x

x
some  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
root. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
the  
x

x
opportunity  
x

x
of  
x

x
scrambling  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
while  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
held  
x

x
steady  
x

x
against  
x

x
  
x

x
another. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
he  
x

x
crawled  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
drowned  
x

x
rat,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
lay  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
spread  
x

x
out  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
the  
x

x
balance  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
best  
x

x
he  
x

x
could. 
x

x
The  
x

x
breeze  
x

x
was  
x

x
cold  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
hoped  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
roll  
x

x
off  
x

x
again  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
started  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
more. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
broke  
x

x
free  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
off  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
current. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
as  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
to  
x

x
stick  
x

x
on  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
feared;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
managed  
x

x
it  
x

x
somehow,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
miserably  
x

x
uncomfortable. 
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
big  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
being  
x

x
rather  
x

x
leaky  
x

x
had  
x

x
now  
x

x
shipped  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
amount  
x

x
of  
x

x
water. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
like  
x

x
trying  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
ride,  
x

x
without  
x

x
bridle  
x

x
or  
x

x
stirrups,  
x

x
a  
x

x
round-bellied  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
pony  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
of  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
grass. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
hand  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
thinner. 
x

x
He  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
paler  
x

x
sky  
x

x
between  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dark  
x

x
river  
x

x
opened  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
wide,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
joined  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
water  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
flowing  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
haste  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
king's  
x

x
great  
x

x
doors. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
dim  
x

x
sheet  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
overshadowed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
sliding  
x

x
surface  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
and  
x

x
broken  
x

x
  
x

x
reflections  
x

x
of  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
stars. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
water  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
swept  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
company  
x

x
of  
x

x
casks  
x

x
and  
x

x
tubs  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
north  
x

x
  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
bay. 
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
shingly  
x

x
shore  
x

x
under  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
banks  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
walled  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
end  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
jutting  
x

x
  
x

x
cape  
x

x
of  
x

x
hard  
x

x
rock. 
x

x
On  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
shore  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
ran  
x

x
aground,  
x

x
though  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
bump  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
stony  
x

x
pier. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
people  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
look-out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
banks. 
x

x
They  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
poled  
x

x
and  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
together  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallows,  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
counted  
x

x
them  
x

x
they  
x

x
roped  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
and  
x

x
left  
x

x
them  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
Poor  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves!  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
badly  
x

x
off  
x

x
now. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
and  
x

x
waded  
x

x
ashore,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
sneaked  
x

x
along  
x

x
to  
x

x
some  
x

x
huts  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
water’s  
x

x
edge. 
x

x
He  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
twice  
x

x
about  
x

x
picking  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
supper  
x

x
  
x

x
uninvited  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
the  
x

x
chance,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
obliged  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
it  
x

x
for  
x

x
so  
x

x
long,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
too  
x

x
well  
x

x
what  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
really  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
merely  
x

x
politely  
x

x
interested  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dainties  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
well-filled  
x

x
larder. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
appealed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
dripping  
x

x
and  
x

x
ragged  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
  
x

x
clinging  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
clammy. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
need  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
that  
x

x
night,  
x

x
for  
x

x
now  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastward  
x

x
journey  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
and  
x

x
greatest  
x

x
adventure,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
must  
x

x
hurry  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
course  
x

x
helped  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
ring  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
on  
x

x
very  
x

x
well  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
given  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
wet  
x

x
footsteps  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
trail  
x

x
of  
x

x
drippings  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
left  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
or  
x

x
sat;  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
snivel,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
he  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
hide  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
terrific  
x

x
explosions  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
suppressed  
x

x
  
x

x
sneezes. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
soon  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
village  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
riverside;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods  
x

x
carrying  
x

x
a  
x

x
loaf  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
leather  
x

x
bottle  
x

x
of  
x

x
wine  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
pie  
x

x
that  
x

x
did  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
belong  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rest  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
pass  
x

x
wet  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
and  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottle  
x

x
helped  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
that,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
actually  
x

x
  
x

x
dozed  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
on  
x

x
some  
x

x
dry  
x

x
leaves,  
x

x
even  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
yearwas  
x

x
getting  
x

x
late  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
airwas  
x

x
chilly. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
woke  
x

x
again  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
specially  
x

x
loud  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
sneeze. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
already  
x

x
grey  
x

x
morning,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
racket  
x

x
down  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
river. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
making  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
raft  
x

x
of  
x

x
barrels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft-  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
would  
x

x
soon  
x

x
be  
x

x
steering  
x

x
it  
x

x
off  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stream  
x

x
to  
x

x
Lake-town. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sneezed  
x

x
again. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
dripping  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
cold  
x

x
all  
x

x
over. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
down  
x

x
as  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
his  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
take  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
managed  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
mass  
x

x
of  
x

x
casks  
x

x
without  
x

x
being  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
general  
x

x
bustle. 
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
sun  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
cast  
x

x
an  
x

x
awkward  
x

x
shadow,  
x

x
and  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
mercy  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
sneeze  
x

x
again  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
pushing  
x

x
of  
x

x

x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
standing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
water  
x

x
  
x

x
heaved  
x

x
and  
x

x
shoved. 
x

x
The  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
now  
x

x
all  
x

x
lashed  
x

x
  
x

x
together  
x

x
creaked  
x

x
and  
x

x
fretted. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
load!”  
x

x
some  
x

x
grumbled. 
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
float  
x

x
too  
x

x
deep  
x

x
—  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
are  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
empty. 
x

x
If  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
ashore  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
daylight,  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
look  
x

x
inside,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No  
x

x
time  
x

x
now!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
the  
x

x
raftman. 
x

x
“Shove  
x

x
  
x

x
off!”  
x

x
And  
x

x
off  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
at  
x

x
first,  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
the  
x

x
point  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
where  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
stood  
x

x
to  
x

x
fend  
x

x
them  
x

x
off  
x

x
with  
x

x
poles,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
quicker  
x

x
and  
x

x
quicker  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
main  
x

x
stream  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
sailing  
x

x
away  
x

x
down,  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
the  
x

x
dungeons  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
but  
x

x
whether  
x

x
alive  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
dead  
x

x
still

remains

x

x
A  
x

x
WARM  
x

x
WELCOME  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
day  
x

x
grew  
x

x
lighter  
x

x
and  
x

x
warmer  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
floated  
x

x
along. 
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
rounded  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
steep  
x

x
shoulder  
x

x
of  
x

x
land  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
left. 
x

x
Under  
x

x
its  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
feet  
x

x
like  
x

x
an  
x

x
inland  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
deepest  
x

x
stream  
x

x
had  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
lapping  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bubbling. 
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
fell  
x

x
away. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
shores  
x

x
sank. 
x

x
The  
x

x
trees  
x

x
ended. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
saw  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
sight:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
lands  
x

x
opened  
x

x
wide  
x

x
about  
x

x
him,  
x

x
filled  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
which  
x

x
broke  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
winding  
x

x
courses,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
halted  
x

x
in  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
and  
x

x
pools  
x

x
dotted  
x

x
with  
x

x
isles  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
every  
x

x
side;  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
a  
x

x
strong  
x

x
water  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
midst. 
x

x
And  
x

x
far  
x

x
away,  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
head  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
torn  
x

x
cloud,  
x

x
there  
x

x
loomed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!  
x

x
Its  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
neighbours  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
North-  
x

x
  
x

x
East  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
tumbled  
x

x
land  
x

x
that  
x

x
joined  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen. 
x

x
All  
x

x
alone  
x

x
it  
x

x
rose  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
far  
x

x
and  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
look  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
least. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
he  
x

x
listened  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
talk  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
raftmen  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pieced  
x

x
together  
x

x
the  
x

x
scraps  
x

x
of  
x

x
information  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
let  
x

x
fall,  
x

x
he  
x

x
soon  
x

x
realized  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
fortunate  
x

x
ever  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
seen  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
even  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
distance. 
x

x
Dreary  
x

x
as  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
imprisonment  
x

x
and  
x

x
unpleasant  
x

x
as  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
position  
x

x
(to  
x

x
say  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
poor  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
underneath  
x

x
him)  
x

x
still,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
more  
x

x
lucky  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
guessed. 
x

x
The  
x

x
talk  
x

x
was  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trade  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
waterways  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
growth  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
traffic  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
as  
x

x
the

x

x
roads  
x

x

of

Mirkwood

disuse;

the

care

of

the

banks. 
x

x
Those  
x

x
lands  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
changed  
x

x
much  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
when  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
dwelt  
x

x
in  
x

x
the

Mountain,  
x

x
days  
x

x
which  
x

x
most  
x

x
people  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
only  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
shadowy  
x

x
  
x

x
tradition. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
changed  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
recent  
x

x
  
x

x
years,  
x

x
and  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
news  
x

that  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
of

them. 
x

x
Great  
x

x
floods  
x

x
and  
x

x
rains  
x

x
had  
x

x
swollen  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
that  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
east;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
earthquake  
x

x
or  
x

x
two

(which

some

him

chiefly

with

a

an

x

x
The  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bogs  
x

x
had

spread

wider

wider  
x

x
on  
x

x
either

side. 
x

x
Paths

had

vanished,

and  
x

x
many  
x

x
a

x
rider  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wanderer  
x

x
too,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had

x
tried

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the

lost

ways  
x

x
across. 
x

x
The

elf-road

through

x
the

x
wood  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
followed  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
advice  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
now  
x

x
came

to

a

the

eastern

x

x
only

the

river

x
offered  
x

x
any

longer

x
a

safe

way  
x

from

the

of

Mirkwood

plains

So  
x

x
you

see

x
Bilbo

had

only

road  
x

x
that  
x

was  
x

any

x

x
It

x
might

have

Mr.

Baggins

shivering

on

the

if

that

Gandalf

away

that

he

of

Thorin’s

x

x
But  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
hungry,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
cold  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
nose,  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
frown  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
threaten  
x

x
him  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
drew  
x

x
ever  
x

x
nearer. 
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
southerly  
x

x
course  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
receded  
x

x
  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
late  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
day  
x

x
the  
x

x
shores  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
grew  
x

x
rocky,  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
all  
x

x
its  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
  
x

x
waters  
x

x
together  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
rapid  
x

x
flood,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
swept  
x

x
along  
x

x
at  
x

x
great  
x

x
speed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
had  
x

x
set  
x

x
when  
x

x
turning  
x

x
with  
x

x
another  
x

x
  
x

x
sweep  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
East  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest-river  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
There  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
stony  
x

x
clifflike  
x

x
gates  
x

x
at  
x

x
either  
x

x
side  
x

x
whose  
x

x
  
x

x
feet  
x

x
were  
x

x
piled  
x

x
with  
x

x
shingles. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Long  
x

x
Lake!  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
imagined  
x

x
that  
x

x
any  
x

x
water  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
sea  
x

x
could  
x

x
look  
x

x
so  
x

x
big. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
wide  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
opposite  
x

x
shores  
x

x
looked  
x

x
small  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
far,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
long  
x

x
that  
x

x
its  
x

x
northerly  
x

x
end,  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
pointed  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
map  
x

x
did  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
that  
x

x
away  
x

x
up  
x

x
there,  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Wain  
x

x
were  
x

x
already  
x

x
twinkling,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
from  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
deep  
x

x
waters  
x

x
what  
x

x
must  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
deep  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
southern  
x

x
end  
x

x
the  
x

x
doubled  
x

x
waters  
x

x
poured  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
over  
x

x
high  
x

x
waterfalls  
x

x
and  
x

x
ran  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
hurriedly  
x

x
to  
x

x
unknown  
x

x
lands. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
still  
x

x
evening  
x

x
  
x

x
air  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
falls  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
heard  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
distant  
x

x
roar. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
strange  
x

x
town  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
speak  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
cellars. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
built  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore,  
x

x
though  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
huts  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
buildings  
x

x
there,  
x

x
but  
x

x
right  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
surface  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake,  
x

x
protected  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
swirl  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
entering  
x

x
  
x

x
river  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
promontory  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
which  
x

x
formed  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
calm  
x

x
bay. 
x

x
A  
x

x
great  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
wood  
x

x
ran  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
where  
x

x
on  
x

x
huge  
x

x
piles  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
forest  
x

x
trees  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
built  
x

x
a  
x

x
busy  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
town,  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
town  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
but  
x

x
of  
x

x
Men,  
x

x
who  
x

x
still  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
dwell  
x

x
here  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
distant  
x

x
dragon-  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain. 
x

x
They  
x

x
still  
x

x
throve  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
trade  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
river  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
South  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
carted  
x

x
past  
x

x
the  
x

x
falls  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
town;  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
days  
x

x
of  
x

x
old,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
rich  
x

x
and  
x

x
prosperous,  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
wealthy  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
powerful,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
fleets  
x

x
of  
x

x
boats  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
were  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
with  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
in  
x

x
armour,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
wars  
x

x
and  
x

x
deeds  
x

x
which  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
legend. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rotting  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
greater  
x

x
town  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
still  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
shores  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
  
x

x
sank  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
drought. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
men  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
little  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
that,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
still  
x

x
sang  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf-kings  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
Thror  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thrain  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
race  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Durin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
coming  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fall  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lords  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
sang  
x

x
too  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
Thror  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thrain  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
gold  
x

x
would  
x

x
flow  
x

x
in  
x

x
rivers,  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-  
x

x
  
x

x
gates,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
land  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
and  
x

x
new  
x

x
laughter. 
x

x
But  
x

x
this  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
legend  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
much  
x

x
affect  
x

x
their  
x

x
daily  
x

x
business. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft  
x

x
of  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
sight  
x

x
  
x

x
boats  
x

x
rowed  
x

x
out  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
voices  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft-steerers. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
cast  
x

x
and  
x

x
oars  
x

x
were  
x

x
pulled,  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
current  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
towed  
x

x
away  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
high  
x

x
shoulder  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
bay  
x

x
of  
x

x
Lake-town. 
x

x
There  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
moored  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
shoreward  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
bridge. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
men  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
South  
x

x
and  
x

x
take  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
casks  
x

x
away,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
others  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
fill  
x

x
with  
x

x
goods  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
taken  
x

x
back  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Wood-elves’  
x

x
home. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
were  
x

x
left  
x

x
afloat  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
boatmen  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
feast  
x

x
in  
x

x
Lake-town. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
surprised,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
seen  
x

x
what  
x

x
happened  
x

x
down  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore,  
x

x
after  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shades  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen. 
x

x
First  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
a  
x

x
barrel  
x

x
was  
x

x
cut  
x

x
  
x

x
loose  
x

x
by  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
opened. 
x

x
Groans  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
crept  
x

x
a  
x

x
most  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
dwarf. 
x

x
Wet  
x

x
straw  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
draggled  
x

x
beard;  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
sore  
x

x
and  
x

x
stiff,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
bruised  
x

x
and  
x

x
buffeted  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
stand  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
stumble  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
water  
x

x
to  
x

x
lie  
x

x
  
x

x
groaning  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
famished  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
savage  
x

x
look  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
dog  
x

x
that  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
chained  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
kennel  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
week. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
but  
x

x
you  
x

x
could  
x

x
only  
x

x
have  
x

x
told  
x

x
it  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
golden  
x

x
chain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
colour  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
now  
x

x
dirty  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
tattered  
x

x
sky-blue  
x

x
hood  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
tarnished  
x

x
  
x

x
silver  
x

x
tassel. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
even  
x

x
polite  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
alive  
x

x
or  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
dead?”  
x

x
  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
quite  
x

x
crossly. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
had  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
one  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
meal  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
the  
x

x
use  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms  
x

x
and  
x

x
legs,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
speak  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
greater  
x

x
  
x

x
allowance  
x

x
of  
x

x
air. 
x

x
“Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
still  
x

x
in  
x

x
prison,  
x

x
or  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
free?  
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
food,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
this  
x

x
silly  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
—  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
yours  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
mine  
x

x
—  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
slap  
x

x
your  
x

x
arms  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
rub  
x

x
your  
x

x
legs  
x

x
and  
x

x
try  
x

x
and  
x

x
help  
x

x
me  
x

x
get  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
out  
x

x
while  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
chance!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
sense  
x

x
of  
x

x
this,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
more  
x

x
groans  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
helped  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
  
x

x
floundering  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
water  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
very  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
job  
x

x
finding  
x

x
which  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
  
x

x
barrels. 
x

x
Knocking  
x

x
outside  
x

x
and  
x

x
calling  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
about  
x

x
six  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
that  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
unpacked  
x

x
and  
x

x
helped  
x

x
  
x

x
ashore  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
or  
x

x
lay  
x

x
muttering  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
moaning;  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
so  
x

x
soaked  
x

x
and  
x

x
bruised  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cramped  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
yet  
x

x
realize  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
release  
x

x
or  
x

x
be  
x

x
properly  
x

x
thankful  
x

x
for  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Dwalin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
were  
x

x
two  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
unhappy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
asking  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
help. 
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
were  
x

x
less  
x

x
knocked  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
drier,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
would  
x

x
do  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
young  
x

x
  
x

x
(for  
x

x
dwarves)  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
also  
x

x
been  
x

x
packed  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
neatly  
x

x
with  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
of  
x

x
straw  
x

x
into  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
casks,  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
smiling,  
x

x
with  
x

x
only  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
bruise  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
stiffness  
x

x
that  
x

x
soon  
x

x
wore  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
smell  
x

x
the  
x

x
smell  
x

x
of  
x

x
apples  
x

x
  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Fili. 
x

x
“My  
x

x
tub  
x

x
was  
x

x
full  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
To  
x

x
smell  
x

x
  
x

x
apples  
x

x
everlastingly  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
scarcely  
x

x
  
x

x
move  
x

x
and  
x

x
are  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
sick  
x

x
with  
x

x
hunger  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
maddening. 
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
eat  
x

x
anything  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide  
x

x
  
x

x
world  
x

x
now,  
x

x
for  
x

x
hours  
x

x
on  
x

x
end  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
an  
x

x
apple!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
the  
x

x
willing  
x

x
help  
x

x
of  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
the  
x

x
remainder  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
company  
x

x
and  
x

x
got  
x

x
them  
x

x
out. 
x

x
Poor  
x

x
fat  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
was  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
or  
x

x
senseless;  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
  
x

x
Ori,  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
were  
x

x
waterlogged  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
only  
x

x
half  
x

x
alive;  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
carried  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
and  
x

x
laid  
x

x
helpless  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well!  
x

x
Here  
x

x
we  
x

x
are!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
we

ought

to

our

stars  
x

x
and  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
a  
x

x
right

to

expect

it,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
arranged  
x

x
a  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
journey. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
—  
x

x
all  
x

x
very  
x

x
much  
x

x
at  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
service  
x

x
once  
x

x
more,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins. 
x

x
No  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
feel  
x

x
properly  
x

x
grateful,  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
fed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
recovered. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
what  
x

x
next?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
suggest  
x

x
Lake-town,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
  
x

x
else  
x

x
is  
x

x
there?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
else  
x

x
could,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
suggested;  
x

x
so  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
went  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
bridge. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
guards  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
careful  
x

x
watch,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
long  
x

x
since  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
any  
x

x
real  
x

x
need. 
x

x
Except  
x

x
for  
x

x
occasional  
x

x
  
x

x
squabbles  
x

x
about  
x

x
river-tolls  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
friends  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves. 
x

x
Other  
x

x
folk  
x

x
were  
x

x
far  
x

x
away;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
younger  
x

x
people  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
  
x

x
openly  
x

x
doubted  
x

x
the  
x

x
existence  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
greybeards  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
gammers  
x

x
who  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
flying  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
young  
x

x
days. 
x

x
That  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
surprising  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
drinking  
x

x
and  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hut,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
unpacking  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
footsteps  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
four  
x

x
scouts. 
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
astonishment  
x

x
was  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
when  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
Oakenshield  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
in  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
want?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
and  
x

x
groping  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
weapons. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thorin  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain  
x

x
son  
x

of  
x

x
Thror  
x

x
King  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
  
x

x
voice,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
looked  
x

x
it,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
torn  
x

x
  
x

x
clothes  
x

x
and  
x

x
draggled  
x

x
hood. 
x

x
The  
x

x
gold  
x

x
gleamed  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
neck  
x

x
and  
x

x
waist;  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
were  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
deep. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
back. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to

see

the

Master

of  
x

x
your  
x

x
town!  
x

x
”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
excitement. 
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
more  
x

x
foolish  
x

x
ran  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hut  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
expected  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
golden  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
turn  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
away. 
x

x
The  
x

x
captain  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
guard  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
forward. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“And  
x

x
who  
x

x
are  
x

x
these?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked,  
x

x
pointing  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
sons  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
father’s  
x

x
daughter,”  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
race  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Durin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
who  
x

x
has  
x

x
travelled  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
us  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
West.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“If  
x

x
you  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
peace  
x

x
lay  
x

x
down  
x

x
your  
x

x
arms!”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
captain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
have  
x

x
none,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
true  
x

x
enough:  
x

x
their  
x

x
knives  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
taken  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood-elves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
sword  
x

x
  
x

x
Orcrist  
x

x
too. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
his  
x

x
short  
x

x
sword,  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
usual,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
about  
x

x
that. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
need  
x

x
of  
x

x
weapons,  
x

x
who  
x

x
return  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

own  
x

as  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
of

old. 
x

x
Nor  
x

x
could  
x

x
we  
x

x
fight  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
against

so  
x

x
many. 
x

x
Take  
x

us  
x

to

your

master!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He  
x

x
is  
x

x
at  
x

x
feast,”  
x

x
said  
x

the

captain.

“Then

all

the

for

us

to

him,”  
x

x
burst  
x

x
in  
x

x
Fili,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
impatient  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
solemnities. 
x

x
“We  
x

are  
x

x
worn  
x

x
and  
x

x
famished  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
our  
x

x
long  
x

x
road  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
sick  
x

x
comrades. 
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
make  
x

x
haste  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
us  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
words,  
x

x
or  
x

x
your  
x

x
master  
x

x
may  
x

x
have  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
say

to  
x

x
you.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Follow  
x

x
me  
x

x
then,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
captain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
six  
x

x
men  
x

x
about  
x

x
them  
x

x
he  
x

x
led  
x

x
them  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

the

gates

into  
x

x
the  
x

x
market-place  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
town. 
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
circle  
x

x
of  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
water  
x

x
  
x

x
surrounded  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
tall  
x

x
piles  
x

x
on  
x

x
which  
x

were  
x

x
built  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
greater  
x

x
houses,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
long  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
quays  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
steps  
x

x
and

ladders

going

down

to  
x

x
the

surface

of

the

lake. 
x

x
From  
x

x
one  
x

x
great  
x

x
hall  
x

x
shone  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
lights  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
voices. 
x

x
They  
x

x
passed  
x

x
its  
x

x
doors  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
  
x

x
blinking  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
looking  
x

x
at  
x

x
long  
x

x
tables  
x

x
filled  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
folk. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

Thorin

cried

Thorin

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
loud  
x

x
voice  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
captain  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
say  
x

x
anything. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Master  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
town  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
great  
x

x
chair. 
x

x
But  
x

x
none  
x

x
rose  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
greater  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft-men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Pressing  
x

x
forward  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master’s  
x

x
table  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
cried:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“These  
x

x
are  
x

x
prisoners  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
king  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
escaped,  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
vagabond  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
give  
x

x
any  
x

x
good  
x

x
account  
x

x
of  
x

x
themselves,  
x

x
  
x

x
sneaking  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods  
x

x
and  
x

x
molesting  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
people!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Is  
x

x
this  
x

x
true?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
far  
x

x
more  
x

x
likely  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
return  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
if  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
person  
x

x
had  
x

x
ever  
x

x
existed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
true  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
were  
x

x
wrongfully  
x

x
waylaid  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
and  
x

x
imprisoned  
x

x
without  
x

x
cause  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
journeyed  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
our  
x

x
own  
x

x
land,”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
lock  
x

x
nor  
x

x
bar  
x

x
may  
x

x
hinder  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
homecoming  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
of  
x

x
old. 
x

x
Nor  
x

x
is  
x

x
this  
x

x
town  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves’  
x

x
realm. 
x

x
I  
x

x
speak  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
raft-  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
king.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
hesitated  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
other. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
powerful  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
parts  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
wished  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
no  
x

x
enmity  
x

x
with  
x

x
him,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
did  
x

x
he  
x

x
think  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs,  
x

x
giving  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
to  
x

x
trade  
x

x
and  
x

x
tolls,  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
cargoes  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
to  
x

x
which  
x

x
habit  
x

x
he  
x

x
owed  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
position. 
x

x
Others  
x

x
were  
x

x
of  
x

x
different  
x

x
mind,  
x

x
  
x

x
however,  
x

x
and  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
the  
x

x
matter  
x

x
was  
x

x
settled  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
him. 
x

x
The  
x

x
news  
x

x
had  
x

x
spread  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
like  
x

x
fire  
x

x
through  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
town. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
People  
x

x
were  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
outside  
x

x
it. 
x

x
The  
x

x
quays  
x

x
were  
x

x
thronged  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
feet. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sing  
x

x
snatches  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs  
x

x
concerning  
x

x
the  
x

x
return  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain;  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
Thror’s  
x

x
  
x

x
grandson  
x

x
not  
x

x
Thror  
x

x
himself  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
bother  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Others  
x

x
took  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
loud  
x

x
and  
x

x
high  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
King  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
  
x

x
The

x
  
x

x
The

x

x
of  
x

x
silver  
x

x
fountains  
x

x
  
x

x
Shall

into

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

His

His

be

x

x
  
x

x
His

x

x
shall

golden  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
songs  
x

x
of  
x

x
yore  
x

x
re-sung. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
mods  
x

x
shall  
x

x
wave  
x

x
on

x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
grass  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
shall

x
flowin

x
And  
x

x
the

golden  
x

x
run. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
streams  
x

x
shall  
x

x
run  
x

x
in  
x

x
gladness,  
x

x
  
x

x
The

lakes  
x

shall

x

x
All  
x

x
sorrowfail  
x

x
and  
x

x
sadness  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain-king’s  
x

x
return!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
sang,  
x

x
or  
x

x
very  
x

x
like  
x

x
that,  
x

x
only  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
deal  
x

x
more  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
music  
x

x
of  
x

x
harps  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
fiddles  
x

x
mixed  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
known  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
memory  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
oldest  
x

x
grandfather. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
  
x

x
greatly  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
afraid. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
how  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
their  
x

x
king  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
serious  
x

x
mistake. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
else  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
obey  
x

x
the  
x

x
general  
x

x
  
x

x
clamour,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
great  
x

x
chair  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
set  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
beside  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
places  
x

x
of  
x

x
honour. 
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
given  
x

x
a  
x

x
seat  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
high  
x

x
table,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
explanation  
x

x
of  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
—  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
songs  
x

x
had  
x

x
alluded  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
obscurest  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
—  
x

x
was  
x

x
asked  
x

x
for  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
general  
x

x
bustle. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
amid  
x

x
scenes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
astonishing  
x

x
enthusiasm. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
doctored  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fed  
x

x
and  
x

x
housed  
x

x
and  
x

x
pampered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
delightful  
x

x
and  
x

x
satisfactory  
x

x
fashion. 
x

x
A  
x

x
large  
x

x
  
x

x
house  
x

x
was  
x

x
given  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
company;  
x

x
  
x

x
boats  
x

x
and  
x

x
rowers  
x

x
were  
x

x
put  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
service;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
crowds  
x

x
sat  
x

x
outside  
x

x
and  
x

x
sang  
x

x
songs  
x

x
all  
x

x
day,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
cheered  
x

x
if  
x

x
any  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
showed  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
nose. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
songs  
x

x
were  
x

x
old  
x

x
ones;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
new  
x

x
and  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
  
x

x
confidently  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
cargoes  
x

x
of  
x

x
rich  
x

x
presents  
x

x
coming  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
Lake-town. 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
inspired  
x

x
  
x

x
largely  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
please  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
but  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
meantime  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
well  
x

x
contented  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
grew  
x

x
fat  
x

x
and  
x

x
strong  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
within  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
week  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
quite  
x

x
recovered,  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
fine  
x

x
cloth  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
proper  
x

x
colours,  
x

x
with  
x

x
beards  
x

x
  
x

x
combed  
x

x
and  
x

x
trimmed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
proud  
x

x
steps. 
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
and  
x

x
walked  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
his  
x

x
kingdom  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
already  
x

x
regained  
x

x
and  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
chopped  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
pieces. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
said,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves’  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
grew  
x

x
stronger  
x

x
  
x

x
every  
x

x
day. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
groans  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
grumbles. 
x

x
They  
x

x
drank  
x

x
his  
x

x
health,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
patted  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
fuss  
x

x
of  
x

x
him;  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
well,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
cheerful. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
the  
x

x
look  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
besides  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
shocking  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
For  
x

x
three  
x

x
days  
x

x
he  
x

x
sneezed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
coughed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
out,  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
that  
x

x
his  
x

x
speeches  
x

x
at  
x

x
banquets  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
limited  
x

x
to  
x

x
“Thag  
x

x
you  
x

x
very  
x

x
buch.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
cargoes,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
great  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
king’s  
x

x
  
x

x
palace. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
what  
x

x
happened  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
chief  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
butler. 
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
was  
x

x
ever  
x

x
said  
x

x
about  
x

x
keys  
x

x
or  
x

x
barrels  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
stayed  
x

x
in  
x

x
Lake-town,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
careful  
x

x
never  
x

x
to  
x

x
become  
x

x
invisible. 
x

x
  
x

x
Still,  
x

x
I  
x

x
daresay,  
x

x
more  
x

x
was  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
than  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
known,  
x

x
though  
x

x
doubtless  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
remained  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
mystery. 
x

x
In  
x

x
any  
x

x
case  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
knew  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves’  
x

x
errand,  
x

x
or  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
did,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
well!  
x

x
We’ll  
x

x
see!  
x

x
No  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
will  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
through  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
without  
x

x
my  
x

x
having  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
matter. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
all  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
end,  
x

x
and  
x

x
serve  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
right!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
believe  
x

x
in  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
and  
x

x
killing  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
like  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
strongly  
x

x
suspected  
x

x
attempted  
x

x
burglary  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
like  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
which  
x

x
shows  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
wise  
x

x
  
x

x
elf  
x

x
and  
x

x
wiser  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
right,  
x

x
as  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
see  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
sent  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
spies  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
shores  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
northward  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
go,  
x

x
and  
x

x
waited. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
fortnight  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
departure. 
x

x
While  
x

x
the  
x

x
enthusiasm  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
lasted  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
help. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
everything  
x

x
cool  
x

x
down  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
delay. 
x

x
So  
x

x
he  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
councillors  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
company  
x

x
must  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
frightened;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
really  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
descendant  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
kings. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
would  
x

x
actually  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
approach  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
but  
x

x
believed  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
frauds  
x

x
who  
x

x
would  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
or  
x

x
later  
x

x
be  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
be  
x

x
turned  
x

x
out. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
wrong. 
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course,  
x

x
was  
x

x
really  
x

x
the  
x

x
grandson  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
knowing  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
and  
x

x
do  
x

x
for  
x

x
revenge  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
recovery  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
go. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
expensive  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
arrival  
x

x
had  
x

x
turned  
x

x
things  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
holiday  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
business  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
standstill. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
bother  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
how  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
welcomes  
x

x
them!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
“Certainly,  
x

x
O  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Thrain’s  
x

x
son  
x

x
Thror’s  
x

x
son!”  
x

x
was  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
must  
x

x
claim  
x

x
your  
x

x
own. 
x

x
The  
x

x
hour  
x

x
is  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
of  
x

x
old. 
x

x
What  
x

x
help  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
offer  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
yours,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
trust  
x

x
to  
x

x
your  
x

x
gratitude  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
your  
x

x
kingdom  
x

x
is  
x

x
regained.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
one  
x

x
day,  
x

x
although  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
getting  
x

x
far  
x

x
on,  
x

x
and  
x

x
winds  
x

x
were  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
and  
x

x
leaves  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
falling  
x

x
fast,  
x

x
three  
x

x
large  
x

x
boats  
x

x
left  
x

x
Lake-  
x

x
  
x

x
town,  
x

x
laden  
x

x
with  
x

x
rowers,  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
provisions. 
x

x
Horses  
x

x
and  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
sent  
x

x
round  
x

x
by  
x

x
circuitous  
x

x
paths  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
appointed  
x

x
landing-place. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
Master  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
councillors  
x

x
bade  
x

x
them  
x

x
farewell  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
steps  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town-hall  
x

x
that  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
People  
x

x
sang  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
quays  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
windows. 
x

x
The  
x

x
white  
x

x
oars  
x

x
dipped  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
splashed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
off  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
north  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
stage  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
journey. 
x

x
The  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
person  
x

x
thoroughly  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
 
x

x
Chapter  
x

x
XI  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
ON  
x

x
THE  
x

x
DOORSTEP  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
two  
x

x
days  
x

x
going  
x

x
they  
x

x
rowed  
x

x
right  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
and  
x

x
passed  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
River  
x

x
Running,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
all  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
towering  
x

x
grim  
x

x
and  
x

x
tall  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
stream  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
strong  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
going  
x

x
slow. 
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
third  
x

x
day,  
x

x
some  
x

x
miles  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
they  
x

x
drew  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
or  
x

x
western  
x

x
bank  
x

x
and  
x

x
disembarked. 
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
joined  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
horses  
x

x
with  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
provisions  
x

x
and  
x

x
necessaries  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
use  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
sent  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
packed  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
store  
x

x
under  
x

x
a  
x

x
tent,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
would  
x

x
stay  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
so  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Not  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
songs  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
true!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
they. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
easier  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Dragon  
x

x
and  
x

x
less  
x

x
easy  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
in  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
wild  
x

x
parts. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
their  
x

x
stores  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
need  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
guard,  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
was  
x

x
desolate  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
empty. 
x

x
So  
x

x
their  
x

x
escort  
x

x
left  
x

x
them,  
x

x
making  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
swiftly  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shoreward  
x

x
paths,  
x

x
  
x

x
although  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
was  
x

x
already  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
spent  
x

x
a  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
lonely  
x

x
night  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
spirits  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
day  
x

x
they  
x

x
set  
x

x
out  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
rode  
x

x
behind,  
x

x
each  
x

x
leading  
x

x
another  
x

x
  
x

x
pony  
x

x
heavily  
x

x
laden  
x

x
beside  
x

x
him;  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
way  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
picking  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
slow  
x

x
road,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
paths. 
x

x
They  
x

x
made  
x

x
north-west,  
x

x
  
x

x
slanting  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
River  
x

x
Running,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
ever  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
and  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
spur  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
flung  
x

x
out  
x

x
southwards  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
weary  
x

x
journey,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
stealthy  
x

x
one. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
laughter  
x

x
or  
x

x
song  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
harps,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
pride  
x

x
and  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
singing  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
songs  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
died  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
plodding  
x

x
  
x

x
gloom. 
x

x
They  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
near  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
end. 
x

x
The  
x

x
land  
x

x
about  
x

x
them  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
bleak  
x

x
and  
x

x
barren,  
x

x
though  
x

x
once,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
fair. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
neither  
x

x
  
x

x
bush  
x

x
nor  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
and  
x

x
only  
x

x
broken  
x

x
and  
x

x
blackened  
x

x
  
x

x
stumps  
x

x
to  
x

x
speak  
x

x
of  
x

x
ones  
x

x
long  
x

x
vanished. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Desolation  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
come  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
waning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
year. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
skirts  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
without  
x

x
meeting  
x

x
any  
x

x
danger  
x

x
or  
x

x
any  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon  
x

x
other  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
wilderness  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
lair. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
lay  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
silent  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
ever  
x

x
higher  
x

x
above  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
made  
x

x
their  
x

x
first  
x

x
camp  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
western  
x

x
side  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
southern  
x

x
spur,  
x

x
which  
x

x
ended  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
height  
x

x
called  
x

x
Ravenhill. 
x

x
On  
x

x
this  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
watch-post;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
dared  
x

x
not  
x

x
climb  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
too  
x

x
exposed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

which

all

their

hopes

rested,  
x

x
Thorin

sent

out

a

scouting

For

this

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
purpose  
x

he

Balin

Fili

x

x
Kili,  
x

with

them

went

Bilbo. 
x

x
They

marched

under

the  
x

x
  
x

x
grey  
x

x
and  
x

x
silent  
x

x
cliffs

to  
x

x
the

feet

of

Ravenhill. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
the

river,  
x

x
after  
x

x
winding  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide

loop  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
the

valley

x
of

x
Dale,  
x

x
turned  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
its  
x

x
road  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
flowing  
x

x
swift  
x

x
and  
x

x
noisily. 
x

x
Its  
x

x
  
x

x
bank  
x

x
was  
x

x
bare  
x

x
and  
x

x
rocky,  
x

x
tall  
x

x
and  
x

x
steep  
x

x
above  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream;  
x

x
and  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
out  
x

x
from  
x

x
it  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
narrow  
x

water,

foaming

splashing

among

x

x
many

boulders,  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide  
x

x
valley  
x

x
  
x

x
shadowed  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain’s  
x

x
arms  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
  
x

x
ruins  
x

x
of  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
houses,  
x

x
towers,  
x

x
and  
x

x
walls. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
lies  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
left  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
mountain’s  
x

x
sides  
x

x
were  
x

x
green  
x

x
with  
x

x
woods  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
sheltered  
x

x
valley  
x

x
rich  
x

x
and  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
bells  
x

x
rang  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
town.”  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
both  
x

x
sad  
x

x
and  
x

x
grim  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
this:  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
companions  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon  
x

x
came. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
follow  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
further  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
southern  
x

x
spur,  
x

x
until  
x

x
lying  
x

x
  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
rock  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
look  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
cavernous  
x

x
opening  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
cliff-  
x

x
  
x

x
wall  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River  
x

x
sprang;  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
too  
x

x
there  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
steam  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
smoke. 
x

x
  
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
moved  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
waste,  
x

x
save  
x

x
the  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
a  
x

x
black  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
ominous  
x

x
crow. 
x

x
The  
x

x
only  
x

x
sound  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stony  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
the  
x

x
harsh  
x

x
croak  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
bird. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
shuddered. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
return!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
can  
x

x
do  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
here!  
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
these  
x

x
dark  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
look  
x

x
like  
x

x
spies  
x

x
of  
x

x
evil.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
is  
x

x
still  
x

x
alive  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
halls  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
then  
x

x
—  
x

x
or  
x

x
I  
x

x
imagine  
x

x
so  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
smoke,"  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
prove  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
“though  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
right. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
some  
x

x
time,  
x

x
or  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
be  
x

x
lying  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain-side  
x

x
keeping  
x

x
watch,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
  
x

x
smokes  
x

x
and  
x

x
steams  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

out  
x

of  
x

the

gates:  
x

x
all  
x

x
the

halls

x
within  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
foul  
x

x
reek.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
such  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
thoughts,  
x

x
followed  
x

x
ever  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
croaking  
x

x
crows  
x

x
above  
x

x
them,  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
weary  
x

x
way  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
in  
x

x
June  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
guests  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
fair  
x

x
house  
x

x
of  
x

x
Elrond,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
winter  
x

x
that  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
time  
x

x
now  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
years  
x

x
  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
alone  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
perilous  
x

x
waste  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
hope  
x

x
of  
x

x
further  
x

x
help. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey,  
x

x
but  
x

x
as  
x

x
far  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed,  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
quest. 
x

x
None  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
much  
x

x
spirit  
x

x
left. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
strange  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
had  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
He  
x

x
would  
x

x
often  
x

x
borrow  
x

x
Thorin's  
x

x
  
x

x
map  
x

x
and  
x

x
gaze  
x

x
at  
x

x
it,  
x

x
pondering  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
runes  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
message  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon-letters  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
read. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
he  
x

x
that  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
begin  
x

x
the  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
search  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
western  
x

x
  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
door. 
x

x
They  
x

x
moved  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
camp  
x

x
then  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
narrower  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
dale  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
South  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gates  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
river  
x

x
stood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
walled  
x

x
with  
x

x
lower  
x

x
spurs  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
Two  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
here  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
forward  
x

x
west  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
mass  
x

x
in  
x

x
long  
x

x
steep-sided  
x

x
ridges  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
fell  
x

x
ever  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
plain. 
x

x
On  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
western  
x

x
side  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
fewer  
x

x
signs  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
marauding  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
grass  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies. 
x

x
From  
x

x
this  
x

x
western  
x

x
camp,  
x

x
  
x

x
shadowed  
x

x
all  
x

x
day  
x

x
by  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
and  
x

x
wall  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
sink  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
day  
x

x
by  
x

x
day  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
toiled  
x

x
in  
x

x
parties  
x

x
searching  
x

x
for  
x

x
paths  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain-side,  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
map  
x

x
was  
x

x
true,  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
must  
x

x
  
x

x
stand  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Day  
x

x
by  
x

x
day  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
camp  
x

x
without  
x

x
success. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
unexpectedly  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
seeking. 
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
one  
x

x
day  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
tumbled  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
at  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
southern  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
About  
x

x
midday,  
x

x
creeping  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
stone  
x

x
that  
x

x
stood  
x

x
alone  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
pillar,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
what  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like  
x

x
rough  
x

x
  
x

x
steps  
x

x
going  
x

x
upwards. 
x

x
Following  
x

x
these  
x

x
excitedly  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
found  
x

x
traces  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
  
x

x
track,  
x

x
often  
x

x
lost,  
x

x
often  
x

x
rediscovered,  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
southern  
x

x
ridge  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
brought  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
still  
x

x
narrower  
x

x
  
x

x
ledge,  
x

x
which  
x

x
turned  
x

x
north  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
face  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
Looking  
x

x
down  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
own  
x

x
camp  
x

x
  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Silently,  
x

x
clinging  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
wall  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
right,  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
in  
x

x
single  
x

x
file  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
ledge,  
x

x
till  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
opened  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
turned  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
steep-walled  
x

x
bay,  
x

x
grassy-floored,  
x

x
still  
x

x
and  
x

x
quiet. 
x

x
  
x

x
Its  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
found  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
seen  
x

x
from  
x

x
below  
x

x
because  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
overhang  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
from  
x

x
further  
x

x
off  
x

x
because  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
small  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
looked  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
crack  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
more. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
cave  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
open  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky  
x

x
  
x

x
above;  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
its  
x

x
inner  
x

x
end  
x

x
a  
x

x
flat  
x

x
wall  
x

x
rose  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
part,  
x

x
close  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
smooth  
x

x
and  
x

x
upright  
x

x
as  
x

x
masons'  
x

x
work,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
joint  
x

x
or  
x

x
crevice  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen. 
x

x
No  
x

x
sign  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
of  
x

x
post  
x

x
or  
x

x
lintel  
x

x
or  
x

x
threshold,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
bar  
x

x
or  
x

x
bolt  
x

x
or  
x

x
key-hole;  
x

x
yet  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
at  
x

x
last. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
beat  
x

x
on  
x

x
it,  
x

x
they  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
and  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
at  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
implored  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
move,  
x

x
they  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
fragments  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
broken  
x

x
spells  
x

x
of  
x

x
opening,  
x

x
and  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
stirred. 
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
tired  
x

x
out  
x

x
they  
x

x
rested  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass  
x

x
at  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
at  
x

x
evening  
x

x
began  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
climb  
x

x
  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp  
x

x
that  
x

x
night. 
x

x
In  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning  
x

x
they  
x

x
prepared  
x

x
to  
x

x
move  
x

x
once  
x

x
more. 
x

x
  
x

x
Only  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
were  
x

x
left  
x

x
behind  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
guard  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
such  
x

x
stores  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
river. 
x

x
The  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
newly  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
path,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
ledge. 
x

x
Along  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
carry  
x

x
no  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
or  
x

x
packs,  
x

x
so  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
breathless  
x

x
was  
x

x
it,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
fall  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fifty  
x

x
feet  
x

x
beside  
x

x
them  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
  
x

x
below;  
x

x
but  
x

x
each  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
coil  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
rope  
x

x
wound  
x

x
tight  
x

x
about  
x

x
his  
x

x
waist,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
mishap  
x

x
they  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
grassy  
x

x
  
x

x
bay. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
their  
x

x
third  
x

x
camp,  
x

x
hauling  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
needed  
x

x
from  
x

x
below  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
ropes. 
x

x
Down  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
able  
x

x
  
x

x
occasionally  
x

x
to  
x

x
lower  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
more  
x

x
active  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
to  
x

x
exchange  
x

x
such  
x

x
news  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
there  
x

x
was,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
a  
x

x
share  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
guard  
x

x
  
x

x
below,  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
was  
x

x
hauled  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
higher  
x

x
  
x

x
camp. 
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
either  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
rope  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
path. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"I  
x

x
am  
x

x
too  
x

x
fat  
x

x
for  
x

x
such  
x

x
fly-walks,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
turn  
x

x
dizzy  
x

x
and  
x

x
tread  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
beard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
thirteen  
x

x
again. 
x

x
And  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
knotted  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
are  
x

x
too  
x

x
slender  
x

x
for  
x

x
my  
x

x
weight.”  
x

x
  
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
true,  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
see. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
explored  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ledge  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
path  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
led  
x

x
higher  
x

x
and  
x

x
higher  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
venture  
x

x
very  
x

x
far  
x

x
that  
x

x
way,  
x

x
  
x

x
nor  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
much  
x

x
use  
x

x
in  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Out  
x

x
up  
x

x
there  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
silence  
x

x
reigned,  
x

x
broken  
x

x
by  
x

x
no  
x

x

sound

x

x
except  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
crannies  
x

x
of  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
low  
x

x
and  
x

x
never  
x

x
called  
x

x
or  
x

x
sang,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
danger  
x

x
brooded  
x

x
in  
x

x
every  
x

x
rock. 
x

x
The  
x

x
others  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
busy  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
had  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
success. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
too  
x

x
eager  
x

x
to  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
runes  
x

x
or  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon-letters,  
x

x
but  
x

x
tried  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
resting  
x

x
to  
x

x
discover  
x

x
where  
x

x
exactly  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
smooth  
x

x
face  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
was  
x

x
hidden. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
picks  
x

x
and  
x

x
tools  
x

x
of  
x

x
many  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
Lake-town,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
they  
x

x
tried  
x

x
to  
x

x
use  
x

x
  
x

x
these. 
x

x
But  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
struck  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
handles  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
and  
x

x
jarred  
x

x
their  
x

x
arms  
x

x
cruelly,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
steel  
x

x
heads  
x

x
broke  
x

x
or  
x

x
bent  
x

x
like  
x

x
lead. 
x

x
  
x

x
Mining  
x

x
work,  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
clearly,  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
magic  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
shut  
x

x
this  
x

x
door;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
grew  
x

x
terrified,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
echoing  
x

x
noise. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
found  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorstep  
x

x
  
x

x
lonesome  
x

x
and  
x

x
wearisome  
x

x
—  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
doorstep,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
really,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
call  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
grassy  
x

x
space  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
opening  
x

x
the  
x

x
“doorstep”  
x

x
in  
x

x
fun,  
x

x
remembering  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo's  
x

x
words  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
unexpected  
x

x
party  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hobbit-hole,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
sit  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorstep  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
something. 
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
sit  
x

x
and  
x

x
think  
x

x
they  
x

x
did,  
x

x
or  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
  
x

x
aimlessly  
x

x
about,  
x

x
and  
x

x
glummer  
x

x
and  
x

x
glummer  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
became. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
spirits  
x

x
had  
x

x
risen  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
discovery  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
path,  
x

x
but  
x

x
now  
x

x
they  
x

x
sank  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
boots;  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
give  
x

x
it  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
away. 
x

x
The  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
brighter  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
He  
x

x
would  
x

x
do  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
sit  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock-face  
x

x
and  
x

x
stare  
x

x
  
x

x
away  
x

x
west  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening,  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff,  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide  
x

x
lands  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
black  
x

x
wall  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
distances  
x

x
beyond,  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
catch  
x

x
  
x

x
glimpses  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
small  
x

x
and  
x

x
far. 
x

x
If  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
asked  
x

x
him  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
doing  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
answered:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
said  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorstep  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
my  
x

x
job,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
mention  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
so  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
and  
x

x
thinking.”  
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
afraid  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
job,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
what  
x

x
lay  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
blue  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
the  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
  
x

x
Western  
x

x
Land  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
large  
x

x
grey  
x

x
stone  
x

x
lay  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
centre  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
grass  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
stared  
x

x
moodily  
x

x
at  
x

x
it  
x

x
or  
x

x
watched  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
snails. 
x

x
They  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
love  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
shut-in  
x

x
bay  
x

x
with  
x

x
its  
x

x
walls  
x

x
of  
x

x
cool  
x

x
rock,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
of  
x

x
huge  
x

x
size  
x

x
crawling  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
stickily  
x

x
along  
x

x
its  
x

x
sides. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Tomorrow

begins

the  
x

last

of

autumn,”

Thorin

one

day.

“And

down

bit!"  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
heard  
x

x
this  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
just  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
enclosure  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
Gracious!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
“so  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
what

they

it?

It

out

of

their

difficulties,  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

since

the

wizard

left.

Whatever

am

I

something

dreadful

would

happen

to

me  
x

in

x
  
x

x
the

end. 
x

x
I  
x

don’t

I

could

x

x
That  
x

x
night  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
and  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
slept. 
x

x
Next  
x

x
day  
x

x
the

dwarves  
x

x
all  
x

x
went  
x

wandering

x

x
off

x
in  
x

x
various  
x

directions;

some

were

exercising

x
the

ponies

down

below,

some

were

roving  
x

x

x
about

x
the

mountain-side.

All  
x

x
day  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat  
x

gloomily  
x

x
in

the  
x

x
grassy  
x

x
bay  
x

gazing  
x

at

the

x
stone,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
out  
x

x
west  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
opening. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
queer  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
something. 
x

x
“Perhaps  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
will  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
back  
x

x
today,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
distant  
x

x
forest. 
x

x
As  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
turned  
x

x
west  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
of  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
upon  
x

x
its  
x

x
far  
x

x
roof,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
pale  
x

x
leaves. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
orange  
x

x
ball  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
sinking  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
level  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
He  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
pale  
x

x
and  
x

x
faint  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
thin  
x

x
new  
x

x
moon  
x

x
  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
rim  
x

x
of  
x

x
Earth. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
very  
x

x
moment  
x

x
he  
x

x
heard  
x

x
a  
x

x
sharp  
x

x
crack  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him. 
x

x
There  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
stone  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
grass  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
enormous  
x

x
thrush,  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
coal  
x

x
  
x

x
black,  
x

x
its  
x

x
pale  
x

x
yellow  
x

x
breast  
x

x
freckled  
x

x
with  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
spots. 
x

x
Crack!  
x

x
It  
x

x
had  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
snail  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
it  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
Crack!  
x

x
Crack!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
understood. 
x

x
Forgetting  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
danger  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ledge  
x

x
and  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
shouting  
x

x
and  
x

x
waving. 
x

x
Those  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
came  
x

x
tumbling  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
fast  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
ledge  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
what  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
matter;  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
hauled  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
  
x

x
(except  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course:  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
asleep). 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Quickly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
explained. 
x

x
They  
x

x
all  
x

x
fell  
x

x
silent:  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
standing  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
with  
x

x
wagging  
x

x
beards  
x

x
watching  
x

x
  
x

x
impatiently. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
sank  
x

x
lower  
x

x
and  
x

x
lower,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
It  
x

x
sank  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
belt  
x

x
of  
x

x
reddened  
x

x
  
x

x
cloud  
x

x
and  
x

x
disappeared. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
groaned,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
stood  
x

x
almost  
x

x
without  
x

x
moving. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
moon  
x

x
was  
x

x
dipping  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
horizon. 
x

x
Evening  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
coming  
x

x
on. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
when  
x

x
their  
x

x
hope  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
lowest  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
ray  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
finger  
x

x
through  
x

x
a  
x

x
rent  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cloud. 
x

x
A  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
came  
x

x
straight  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bay  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
smooth  
x

x
rock-face. 
x

x
The  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
thrush,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
watching  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
high  
x

x
  
x

x
perch  
x

x
with  
x

x
beady  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
and  
x

x
head  
x

x
cocked  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
side,  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
trill. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
  
x

x
crack. 
x

x
A  
x

x
flake  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
split  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
hole  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
about  
x

x
three  
x

x
feet  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Quickly,  
x

x
trembling  
x

x
lest  
x

x
the  
x

x
chance  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
fade,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
—  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
key!  
x

x
The  
x

x
key!"  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Where  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin?"  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
key!"  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
key  
x

x
that  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
map!  
x

x
Try  
x

x
it  
x

x
now  
x

x
while  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
still  
x

x
time!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
drew  
x

x
the  
x

x
key  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
its  
x

x
chain  
x

x
from  
x

x
round  
x

x
his  
x

x
neck. 
x

x
He  
x

x
put  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hole. 
x

x
It  
x

x
fitted  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
turned!  
x

x
Snap!  
x

x
The  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
out,  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
sank,  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
evening  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
pushed  
x

x
together,  
x

x
and  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock-wall  
x

x
gave  
x

x
way. 
x

x
Long  
x

x
straight  
x

x
  
x

x
cracks  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
and  
x

x
widened. 
x

x
A  
x

x
door  
x

x
five  
x

x
feet  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
and  
x

x
three  
x

x
broad  
x

x
was  
x

x
outlined,  
x

x
and  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
sound  
x

x
swung  
x

x
inwards. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
out  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hole  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-side,  
x

x
and  
x

x
deep  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
lay  
x

x
before  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
a  
x

x
yawning  
x

x
mouth  
x

x
leading  
x

x
in  
x

x
and  
x

x
down.

x

x
For  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
stood  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
debated,  
x

x
until  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
spoke:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
our

Baggins,

who

proved

himself  
x

a

good

companion  
x

x
on

our  
x

long

road,

and  
x

x
a

hobbit

full

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
courage

and

far

exceeding

I

now

our

You

are

familiar

Thorin’s

important

give  
x

x
you  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
deal  
x

x
  
x

x
longer  
x

x
than  
x

x
this. 
x

x
It  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
important  
x

x
  
x

x
occasion,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
impatient. 
x

x
By  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
familiar  
x

x
with  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
too,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
driving  
x

x
at. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“If  
x

x
you  
x

x
mean  
x

x
you  
x

x
think  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
my  
x

x
job  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
passage  
x

x
first,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Thrain’s  
x

x
son  
x

x
  
x

x
Oakenshield,  
x

x
may  
x

x
your  
x

x
beard  
x

x
grow  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
longer,"  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
crossly,  
x

x
“say  
x

x
so  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
done!  
x

x
I  
x

x
might  
x

x
refuse. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
you  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
two  
x

x
messes  
x

x
already,  
x

x
which  
x

x
were  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
original  
x

x
bargain,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
am,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think,  
x

x
already  
x

x
  
x

x
owed  
x

x
some  
x

x
reward. 
x

x
But  
x

x
‘third  
x

x
time  
x

x
pays  
x

x
for  
x

x
all’  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
my  
x

x
father  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
and  
x

x
somehow  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
shall  
x

x
refuse. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
trust  
x

x
my  
x

x
luck  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
I  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
days”  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
meant  
x

x
last  
x

x
spring  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
left  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
house,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
centuries  
x

x
ago  
x

x
—  
x

x
“but  
x

x
  
x

x
anyway  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
peep  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
get  
x

x
it  
x

x
over. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
who  
x

x
is  
x

x
coming  
x

x
with  
x

x
me?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
expect  
x

x
a  
x

x
chorus  
x

x
of  
x

x
volunteers,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
disappointed. 
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
looked  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
leg,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
made  
x

x
no  
x

x
pretence  
x

x
of  
x

x
offering  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
the  
x

x
lookout  
x

x
man,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
rather  
x

x
fond  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
He  
x

x
said  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
inside  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
least  
x

x
and  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
too,  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
call  
x

x
for  
x

x
help  
x

x
if  
x

x
necessary. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
most  
x

x
that  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
said  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
this:  
x

x
they  
x

x
intended  
x

x
to  
x

x
pay  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
really  
x

x
  
x

x
handsomely  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
services;  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
job  
x

x
for  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
mind  
x

x
the  
x

x
poor  
x

x
little  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
doing  
x

x
it  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
would;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
all  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
their  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
trouble,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
into  
x

x
it,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
case  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
any  
x

x
particular  
x

x
  
x

x
reasons  
x

x
for  
x

x
being  
x

x
grateful  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
There  
x

x
it  
x

x
is:  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
heroes,  
x

x
but  
x

x
calculating  
x

x
folk  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
value  
x

x
of  
x

x
money;  
x

x
some  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
tricky  
x

x
and  
x

x
treacherous  
x

x
and  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
bad  
x

x
lots;  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
are  
x

x
not,  
x

x
but  
x

x
are  
x

x
decent  
x

x
enough  
x

x
people  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Company,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
expect  
x

x
  
x

x
too  
x

x
much. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
stars  
x

x
were  
x

x
coming  
x

x
out  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
pale  
x

x
  
x

x
sky  
x

x
barred  
x

x
with  
x

x
black  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
crept  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
stole  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
far  
x

x
easier  
x

x
going  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
expected. 
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
entrance,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
rough  
x

x
wood-elves’  
x

x
cave. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
passage  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
height  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
skill:  
x

x
straight  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
ruler,  
x

x
smooth-floored  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
smooth-sided,  
x

x
going  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
gentle  
x

x
never-varying  
x

x
  
x

x
slope  
x

x
direct  
x

x
—  
x

x
to  
x

x
some  
x

x
distant  
x

x
end  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
blackness  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
bade  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
“Good  
x

x
luck!”  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
still  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
faint  
x

x
  
x

x
outline  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
trick  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
rustle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
whispering  
x

x
  
x

x
voices  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
just  
x

x
outside. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
and  
x

x
warned  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
care  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
no  
x

x
sound,  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
noiselessly  
x

x
down,  
x

x
  
x

x
down,  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
trembling  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
fear,  
x

x
but  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
face  
x

x
was  
x

x
set  
x

x
and  
x

x
grim. 
x

x
  
x

x
Already  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
different  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
one  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
run  
x

x
out  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
pocket-  
x

x
  
x

x
handkerchief  
x

x
from  
x

x
Bag-End  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
pocket-handkerchief  
x

x
for  
x

x
ages. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
loosened  
x

x
his  
x

x
dagger  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
sheath,  
x

x
tightened  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
belt,  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
in  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
last,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
went  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
your  
x

x
foot  
x

x
right  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
night  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
party,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
pull  
x

x
it  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
pay  
x

x
for  
x

x
it!  
x

x
Dear  
x

x
me,  
x

x
what  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
and  
x

x
am!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
least  
x

x
Tookish  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
absolutely  
x

x
no  
x

x
use  
x

x
for  
x

x
dragon-  
x

x
  
x

x
guarded  
x

x
treasures,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
lot  
x

x
could  
x

x
stay  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
if  
x

x
only  
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
wake  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
beastly  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
was  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
front-hall  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
home!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
wake  
x

x
up  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
but  
x

x
went  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
and  
x

x
on,  
x

x
till  
x

x
all  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
behind  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
faded  
x

x
away. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
alone. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
warm. 
x

x
“Is  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
kind  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
glow  
x

x
I  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
coming  
x

x
right  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
down  
x

x
there?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was. 
x

x
As  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
forward  
x

x
it  
x

x
grew  
x

x
and  
x

x
grew,  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
steadily  
x

x
getting  
x

x
redder  
x

x
and  
x

x
redder. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
undoubtedly  
x

x
hot  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
Wisps  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
floated  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
past  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sweat. 
x

x
A  
x

x
sound,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
throb  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
bubbling  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
pot  
x

x
  
x

x
galloping  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
mixed  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
rumble  
x

x
as  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
gigantic  
x

x
tom-cat  
x

x
purring. 
x

x
This  
x

x
grew  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
unmistakable  
x

x
gurgling  
x

x
noise  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
vast  
x

x
  
x

x
animal  
x

x
snoring  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
down  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
red  
x

x
  
x

x
glow  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
at  
x

x
this  
x

x
point  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
stopped. 
x

x
  
x

x
Going  
x

x
on  
x

x
from  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
bravest  
x

x
thing  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
did. 
x

x
The  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
happened  
x

x
  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
were  
x

x
as  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
compared  
x

x
to  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
fought  
x

x
the  
x

x
real  
x

x
battle  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
ever  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
vast  
x

x
danger  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
in  
x

x
wait. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
halt  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
he  
x

x
did;  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
picture  
x

x
him  
x

x
coming  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel,  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
opening  
x

x
of  
x

x
much  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
size  
x

x
and  
x

x
shape  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
above. 
x

x
Through  
x

x
it  
x

x
peeps  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
little  
x

x
head. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
him  
x

x
lies  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
bottom-most  
x

x
cellar  
x

x
or  
x

x
dungeon-hall  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
right  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain’s  
x

x
root. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
almost  
x

x
dark  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
its  
x

x
vastness  
x

x
can  
x

x
only  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
dimly  
x

x
guessed,  
x

x
but  
x

x
rising  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
near  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
floor  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
glow. 
x

x
The  
x

x
glow  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
a  
x

x
vast  
x

x
red-golden  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
fast  
x

x
  
x

x
asleep;  
x

x
a  
x

x
thrumming  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
jaws  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
nostrils,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wisps  
x

x
of  
x

x
smoke,  
x

x
but  
x

x
his  
x

x
fires  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
low  
x

x
in  
x

x
slumber. 
x

x
Beneath  
x

x
him,  
x

x
under  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
limbs  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
huge  
x

x
coiled  
x

x
tail,  
x

x
and  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
sides  
x

x
stretching  
x

x
away  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
unseen  
x

x
floors,  
x

x
  
x

x
lay  
x

x
countless  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
precious  
x

x
things,  
x

x
gold  
x

x
  
x

x
wrought  
x

x
and  
x

x
unwrought,  
x

x
gems  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
silver  
x

x
red-stained  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruddy  
x

x
light. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
with  
x

x
wings  
x

x
folded  
x

x
like  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
immeasurable  
x

x
bat,  
x

x
turned  
x

x
partly  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
side,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
his  
x

x
underparts  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
pale  
x

x
belly  
x

x
crusted  
x

x
with  
x

x
gems  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fragments  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
long  
x

x
lying  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
costly  
x

x
bed. 
x

x
Behind  
x

x
him  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
could  
x

x
dimly  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
coats  
x

x
of  
x

x
mail,  
x

x
  
x

x
helms  
x

x
and  
x

x
axes,  
x

x
swords  
x

x
and  
x

x
spears  
x

x
hanging;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
rows  
x

x
stood  
x

x
great  
x

x
jars  
x

x
and  
x

x
vessels  
x

x
  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
that  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
guessed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
breath  
x

x
was  
x

x
taken  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
description  
x

x
at  
x

x
all. 
x

x
There  
x

x
are  
x

x
no  
x

x
words  
x

x
left  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
express  
x

x
his  
x

x
staggerment,  
x

x
since  
x

x
Men  
x

x
  
x

x
changed  
x

x
the  
x

x
language  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
learned  
x

x
of  
x

x
elves  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
when  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
was  
x

x
wonderful. 
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
tell  
x

x
and  
x

x
sing  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragon-hoards  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
before,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
splendour,  
x

x
the  
x

x
lust,  
x

x
the  
x

x
glory  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
yet  
x

x
come  
x

x
home  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
heart  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
and  
x

x
pierced  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
enchantment  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
desire  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
motionless,  
x

x
almost  
x

x
forgetting  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
frightful  
x

x
guardian,  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
price  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
count. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
for  
x

x
what  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
an  
x

x
age,  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
almost  
x

x
against  
x

x
his  
x

x
will,  
x

x
he  
x

x
stole  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
doorway,  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mounds  
x

x
of  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
Above  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
the  
x

x
sleeping  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
lay,  
x

x
a  
x

x
dire  
x

x
menace  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
sleep. 
x

x
He  
x

x
grasped  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
two-  
x

x
  
x

x
handled  
x

x
cup,  
x

x
as  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
carry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cast  
x

x
one  
x

x
fearful  
x

x
eye  
x

x
upwards. 
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
wing,  
x

x
opened  
x

x
a  
x

x
claw,  
x

x
the  
x

x
rumble  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
snoring  
x

x
  
x

x
changed  
x

x
its  
x

x
note. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
fled. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
wake  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
shifted  
x

x
into  
x

x
other  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
greed  
x

x
and  
x

x
violence,  
x

x
lying  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
stolen  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
toiled  
x

x
back  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
His  
x

x
heart  
x

x
was  
x

x
beating  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
fevered  
x

x
shaking  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
than  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
down,  
x

x
but  
x

x
still  
x

x
he  
x

x
clutched  
x

x
the  
x

x
cup,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
chief  
x

x
thought  
x

x
was:  
x

x
“I’ve  
x

x
done  
x

x
it!  
x

x
This  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
show  
x

x
them. 
x

x
‘More  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
grocer  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar’  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
indeed!  
x

x
Well,  
x

x
we’ll  
x

x
hear  
x

x
no  
x

x
more  
x

x
of  
x

x
that.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Nor  
x

x
did  
x

x
he. 
x

x
Balin  
x

x
was  
x

x
overjoyed  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
delighted  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
surprised. 
x

x
He  
x

x
picked  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
carried  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
open  
x

x
air. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
midnight  
x

x
and  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
covered  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
lay  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
shut,  
x

x
gasping  
x

x
and  
x

x
taking  
x

x
pleasure  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
feel  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fresh  
x

x
air  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
noticing  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
or  
x

x
how  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
praised  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
patted  
x

x
him  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
families  
x

x
for  
x

x
generations  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
service. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
passing  
x

x
the  
x

x
cup  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
hand  
x

x
to  
x

x
hand  
x

x
and  
x

x
talking  
x

x
delightedly  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
recovery  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
treasure,  
x

x
when  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
a  
x

x
vast  
x

x
  
x

x
rumbling  
x

x
woke  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
underneath  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
volcano  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
its  
x

x
mind  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
start  
x

x
eruptions  
x

x
once  
x

x
again. 
x

x
The  
x

x
door  
x

x
behind  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
was  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
to,  
x

x
and  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
closing  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
but  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
echoes,  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
depths,  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
bellowing  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
trampling  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
them  
x

x
tremble. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
their  
x

x
joy  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
confident  
x

x
boasts  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
before  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cowered  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
fright. 
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
reckoned  
x

x
with. 
x

x
It  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
do  
x

x
to  
x

x
leave  
x

x
a  
x

x
live  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
calculations,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
live  
x

x
near  
x

x
  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Dragons  
x

x
may  
x

x
not  
x

x
have  
x

x
much  
x

x
real  
x

x
use  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
wealth,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
know  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
ounce  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rule,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
after  
x

x
long  
x

x
possession;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
exception. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
uneasy  
x

x
dream  
x

x
(in  
x

x
which  
x

x
a  
x

x
warrior,  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
  
x

x
insignificant  
x

x
in  
x

x
size  
x

x
but  
x

x
provided  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
  
x

x
sword  
x

x
and  
x

x
great  
x

x
courage,  
x

x
figured  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
unpleasantly)  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
doze,  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
doze  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
wide  
x

x
waking. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
breath  
x

x
of  
x

x
strange  
x

x
air  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
cave. 
x

x
Could  
x

x
there  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
draught  
x

x
from  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
hole?  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
felt  
x

x
quite  
x

x
happy  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
it,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
so  
x

x
small,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
glared  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
suspicion  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
why  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
it  
x

x
up. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
late  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
half  
x

x
fancied  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
dim  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
knocking  
x

x
sound  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
above  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
through  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
lair. 
x

x
He  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
and  
x

x
stretched  
x

x
forth  
x

x
his  
x

x
neck  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
sniff. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
missed  
x

x
the  
x

x
cup!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thieves!  
x

x
Fire!  
x

x
Murder!  
x

x
Such  
x

x
a  
x

x
thing  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
happened  
x

x
since  
x

x
first  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
rage  
x

x
passes  
x

x
description  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
sort  
x

x
of  
x

x
rage  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
only  
x

x
seen  
x

x
when  
x

x
rich  
x

x
folk  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
enjoy  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
lose  
x

x
something  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
long  
x

x
had  
x

x
but  
x

x
have  
x

x
never  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
used  
x

x
or  
x

x
wanted. 
x

x
His  
x

x
fire  
x

x
belched  
x

x
forth,  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
smoked,  
x

x
he  
x

x
shook  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-roots. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
hole,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
coiling  
x

x
his  
x

x
length  
x

x
together,  
x

x
roaring  
x

x
like  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
  
x

x
underground,  
x

x
he  
x

x
sped  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
deep  
x

x
lair  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
its  
x

x
great  
x

x
door,  
x

x
out  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
huge  
x

x
  
x

x
passages  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-palace  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
hunt  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
caught  
x

x
the  
x

x
thief  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
torn  
x

x
and  
x

x
trampled  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
one  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
He  
x

x
issued  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
waters  
x

x
rose  
x

x
in  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
whistling  
x

x
steam,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
he  
x

x
soared  
x

x
blazing  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
and  
x

x
settled  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-top  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
spout  
x

x
of  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
scarlet  
x

x
  
x

x
flame. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
awful  
x

x
rumour  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
flight,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
crouched  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
grassy  
x

x
terrace  
x

x
cringing  
x

x
under  
x

x
boulders,  
x

x
  
x

x
hoping  
x

x
somehow  
x

x
to  
x

x
escape  
x

x
the  
x

x
frightful  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
all  
x

x
been  
x

x
killed,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
once  
x

x
again. 
x

x
“Quick!  
x

x
  
x

x
Quick!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
gasped. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
door!  
x

x
The  
x

x
tunnel!  
x

x
It’s  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
here.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Roused  
x

x
by  
x

x
these  
x

x
words  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
to  
x

x
creep  
x

x
inside  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bifur  
x

x
  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
cry:  
x

x
“My  
x

x
cousins!  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bofur  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
them,  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
slain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
our  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
too,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
our  
x

x
stores  
x

x
lost,”  
x

x
moaned  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
do  
x

x
nothing.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Nonsense!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
recovering  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
dignity. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
leave  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Get  
x

x
inside  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
two  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
shan’t  
x

x
have  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
us. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
others,  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
the  
x

x
ropes?  
x

x
Be  
x

x
quick!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Those  
x

x
were  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
the  
x

x
worst  
x

x
moments  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
through  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
The  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
sounds  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
anger  
x

x
were  
x

x
echoing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
stony  
x

x
  
x

x
hollows  
x

x
far  
x

x
above;  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
moment  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
blazing  
x

x
down  
x

x
or  
x

x
fly  
x

x
whirling  
x

x
round  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
there,  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
perilous  
x

x
cliffs  
x

x
edge  
x

x
hauling  
x

x
  
x

x
madly  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ropes. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
came  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
safe. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
came  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
blowing  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
creaked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
safe. 
x

x
Up  
x

x
came  
x

x
some  
x

x
tools  
x

x
and  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
stores,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
danger  
x

x
was  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
whirring  
x

x
noise  
x

x
was  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
A  
x

x
red  
x

x
light  
x

x
  
x

x
touched  
x

x
the  
x

x
points  
x

x
of  
x

x
standing  
x

x
rocks. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
came. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
barely  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
fly  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tunnel,  
x

x
pulling  
x

x
and  
x

x
dragging  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
bundles,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
came  
x

x
hurtling  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North,  
x

x
  
x

x
licking  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-sides  
x

x
with  
x

x
flame,  
x

x
beating  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
great  
x

x
wings  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
noise  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
roaring  
x

x
wind. 
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
hot  
x

x
breath  
x

x
shrivelled  
x

x
the  
x

x
grass  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
drove  
x

x
in  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
and  
x

x
scorched  
x

x
them  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
hid. 
x

x
  
x

x
Flickering  
x

x
fires  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
black  
x

x
rock-  
x

x
  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
danced. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
fell  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
passed  
x

x
again. 
x

x
The  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
screamed  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
terror,  
x

x
burst  
x

x
their  
x

x
ropes  
x

x
and  
x

x
galloped  
x

x
wildly  
x

x
off. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
pursue  
x

x
  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That’ll  
x

x
be  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
poor  
x

x
beasts!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Nothing  
x

x
can  
x

x
escape  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
once  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
sees  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Here  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
and  
x

x
here  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
stay,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
any  
x

x
one  
x

x
fancies  
x

x
tramping  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
open  
x

x
miles  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
with  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
watch!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
thought!  
x

x
They  
x

x
crept  
x

x
  
x

x
further  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
lay  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
shivered  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
warm  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuffy,  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
dawn  
x

x
came  
x

x
pale  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
crack  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
Every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
roar  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
flying  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
grow  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
pass  
x

x
and  
x

x
fade,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
round  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-sides. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
traces  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
camps  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
discovered,  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
scaled  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-side  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
standing;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
withstood  
x

x
his  
x

x
searching  
x

x
eye,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
high-walled  
x

x
bay  
x

x
had  
x

x
kept  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
fiercest  
x

x
  
x

x
flames. 
x

x
Long  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
dawn  
x

x
  
x

x
chilled  
x

x
his  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
golden  
x

x
  
x

x
couch  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
gather  
x

x
new  
x

x
strength. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
forget  
x

x
or  
x

x
forgive  
x

x
the  
x

x
theft,  
x

x
not  
x

x
if  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
years  
x

x
turned  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
smouldering  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
afford  
x

x
to  
x

x
wait. 
x

x
Slow  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
silent  
x

x
he  
x

x
crept  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
lair  
x

x
and  
x

x
half  
x

x
closed  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
morning  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
terror  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
grew  
x

x
less. 
x

x
They  
x

x
realized  
x

x
that  
x

x
dangers  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
kind  
x

x
were  
x

x
inevitable  
x

x
in  
x

x
dealing  
x

x
with  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
guardian,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
giving  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
quest  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
Nor  
x

x
could  
x

x
they  
x

x
get  
x

x
away  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
now,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
pointed  
x

x
out. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
lost  
x

x
or  
x

x
killed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
wait  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
relaxed  
x

x
his  
x

x
watch  
x

x
  
x

x
sufficiently  
x

x
for  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
dare  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
way  
x

x
on  
x

x
foot. 
x

x
  
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
saved  
x

x
enough  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
stores  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
them  
x

x
still  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
debated  
x

x
long  
x

x
on  
x

x
what  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
done,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
no  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
getting  
x

x
rid  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
—  
x

x
which  
x

x
had  
x

x
always  
x

x
been  
x

x
a  
x

x
weak  
x

x
point  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
plans,  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
point  
x

x
out. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
as  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
nature  
x

x
of  
x

x
folk  
x

x
that  
x

x
are  
x

x
thoroughly  
x

x
  
x

x
perplexed,  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
grumble  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
blaming  
x

x
him  
x

x
for  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
so  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
  
x

x
them:  
x

x
for  
x

x
bringing  
x

x
away  
x

x
a  
x

x
cup  
x

x
and  
x

x
stirring  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
so  
x

x
soon. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
else  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
do?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
angrily. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
engaged  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
kill  
x

x
dragons,  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
warrior’s  
x

x
work,  
x

x
but  
x

x
to  
x

x
steal  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
I  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
best  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
I  
x

x
could. 
x

x
Did  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
expect  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
trot  
x

x
back  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thror  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
back?  
x

x
If  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
any  
x

x
grumbling  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
done,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
say. 
x

x
You  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
brought  
x

x
five  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
burglars  
x

x
not  
x

x
one. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
it  
x

x
reflects  
x

x
great  
x

x
credit  
x

x
on  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
grandfather,  
x

x
but  
x

x
you  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
pretend  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
made  
x

x
the  
x

x
vast  
x

x
extent  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
clear  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
me. 
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
want  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
years  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
up,  
x

x
if  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
fifty  
x

x
times  
x

x
as  
x

x
big,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
tame  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
course  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
begged  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
pardon. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
then  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
propose  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
do,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
politely. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
idea  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
—  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
mean  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
removing  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
That  
x

x
obviously  
x

x
  
x

x
depends  
x

x
entirely  
x

x
on  
x

x
some  
x

x
new  
x

x
turn  
x

x
of  
x

x
luck  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
getting  
x

x
rid  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
Getting  
x

x
rid  
x

x
of  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
line,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
do  
x

x
my  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Personally  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
safe  
x

x
back  
x

x
at  
x

x
home.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Never  
x

x
mind  
x

x
that  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment!  
x

x
What  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
now,  
x

x
to-day?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
really  
x

x
want  
x

x
my  
x

x
advice,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
say  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
do  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
but  
x

x
stay  
x

x
where  
x

x
we  
x

x
are. 
x

x
  
x

x
By  
x

x
day  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
no  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
creep  
x

x
out  
x

x
safely  
x

x
  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
chosen  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
store  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
replenish  
x

x
our  
x

x
supplies. 
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
everyone  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
well  
x

x
inside  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
by  
x

x
night. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
make  
x

x
you  
x

x
an  
x

x
offer. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
ring  
x

x
and  
x

x
will  
x

x
creep  
x

x
down  
x

x
this  
x

x
very  
x

x
noon  
x

x
—  
x

x
then  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
napping  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
up  
x

x
to. 
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
something  
x

x
will  
x

x
turn  
x

x
  
x

x
up. 
x

x
‘Every  
x

x
worm  
x

x
has  
x

x
his  
x

x
weak  
x

x
spot,’  
x

x
as  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
father  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
though  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
personal  
x

x
experience.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Naturally  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
accepted  
x

x
the  
x

x
offer  
x

x
  
x

x
eagerly. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
respect  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
become  
x

x
the  
x

x
real  
x

x
leader  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
adventure. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
ideas  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
plans  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own. 
x

x
When  
x

x
midday  
x

x
came  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
ready  
x

x
for  
x

x
another  
x

x
journey  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
it  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
so  
x

x
bad  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less,  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Had  
x

x
he  
x

x
known  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
wily  
x

x
ways,  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
more  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
and  
x

x
less  
x

x
hopeful  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
catching  
x

x
this  
x

x
one  
x

x
napping. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
sun  
x

x
was  
x

x
shining  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
started,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
as  
x

x
dark  
x

x
as  
x

x
night  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
The  
x

x
light  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
almost  
x

x
closed,  
x

x
soon  
x

x
faded  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
down. 
x

x
So  
x

x
silent  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
going  
x

x
that  
x

x
smoke  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
gentle  
x

x
wind  
x

x
could  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
have  
x

x
surpassed  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
a  
x

x
bit  
x

x
proud  
x

x
of  
x

x
himself  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
drew  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
door. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
veryfaintestglowto  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Old  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
is  
x

x
weary  
x

x
and  
x

x
asleep,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
thought. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
can’t  
x

x
see  
x

x
me  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
hear  
x

x
  
x

x
me. 
x

x
Cheer  
x

x
up  
x

x
Bilbo!”  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
or  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
about  
x

x
dragons’  
x

x
sense  
x

x
of  
x

x
smell. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
an  
x

x
awkward  
x

x
fact  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
can  
x

x
keep  
x

x
half  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
eye  
x

x
open  
x

x
watching  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
sleep,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
suspicious. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
looked  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep,  
x

x
almost  
x

x
  
x

x
dead  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
with  
x

x
scarcely  
x

x
a  
x

x
snore  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
whiff  
x

x
of  
x

x
unseen  
x

x
steam,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
peeped  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
entrance. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
step  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
thin  
x

x
and  
x

x
piercing  
x

x
ray  
x

x
of  
x

x
red  
x

x
from  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
drooping  
x

x
lid  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
left  
x

x
eye. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
pretending  
x

x
to  
x

x
sleep!  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
watching  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
entrance!  
x

x
Hurriedly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
blessed  
x

x
the  
x

x
luck  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
  
x

x
spoke. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
thief!  
x

x
I  
x

x
smell  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
your  
x

x
air. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hear  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
breath. 
x

x
Come  
x

x
along!  
x

x
Help  
x

x
yourself  
x

x
again,  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
spare!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
quite  
x

x
so  
x

x
unlearned  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon-lore  
x

x
as  
x

x
all  
x

x
that,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
hoped  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
so  
x

x
easily  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
disappointed. 
x

x
"No  
x

x
thank  
x

x
you,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Tremendous!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
replied. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
presents. 
x

x
I  
x

x
only  
x

x
wished  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
look  
x

x
at  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
truly  
x

x
as  
x

x
great  
x

x
as  
x

x
tales  
x

x
say. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
believe  
x

x
them.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Do  
x

x
you  
x

x
now?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
somewhat  
x

x
  
x

x
flattered,  
x

x
even  
x

x
thouqh  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
believe  
x

x
a  
x

x
word  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Truly  
x

x
songs  
x

x
and  
x

x
tales  
x

x
fall  
x

x
utterly  
x

x
short  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
reality,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
Chiefest  
x

x
and  
x

x
Greatest  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Calamities,”  
x

x
replied  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
have  
x

x
nice  
x

x
manners  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
thief  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
liar,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
seem  
x

x
familiar  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
name,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
remember  
x

x
  
x

x
smelling  
x

x
you  
x

x
before. 
x

x
Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
do  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
come  
x

x
from,  
x

x
may  
x

x
I  
x

x
ask?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
may  
x

x
indeed!  
x

x
I  
x

x
come  
x

x
from  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
under  
x

x
the

hills  
x

x
and

x
over  
x

x
the

hills  
x

x
my

paths  
x

x

led. 
x

x
And  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
I  
x

am  
x

x
he

that

walks  
x

x
  
x

x
unseen.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“So  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
well  
x

x
believe,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
“but  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
your

usual  
x

x
name.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

am  
x

x
the

clue-finder,  
x

the

web-cutter,  
x

x
the

x
  
x

x
stinging  
x

fly. 
x

x
I

was

chosen

for

the

lucky  
x

x
number.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Lovely  
x

x
titles!”  
x

x
sneered  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
  
x

x
lucky  
x

x
numbers  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
always  
x

off.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

am

buries

his

friends

alive

and  
x

x
  
x

x
drowns  
x

them

and

draws  
x

x
them  
x

x
alive  
x

x
again  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the

water. 
x

x
I  
x

came  
x

from  
x

x
the

end  
x

x
of  
x

a

bag,

x

x
no

bag  
x

went

over

me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“These  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
sound  
x

x
so  
x

x
creditable,”  
x

x
scoffed  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

am

the

friend

of

I

am  
x

Barrel-rider,”  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

riddling. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That’s  
x

x
better!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
don’t

let

your

imagination

away

you!”

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
of

course

is  
x

the

way

x
to

talk

to

dragons,

if

x
  
x

x
you

don’t

want  
x

x
to  
x

x
reveal  
x

x
your  
x

x
proper  
x

x
name  
x

x
  
x

x
(which  
x

x
is  
x

x
wise),  
x

x
and  
x

x
don’t  
x

want  
x

to

infuriate

them  
x

by  
x

x
a  
x

x
flat  
x

x
refusal  
x

x
(which  
x

x
is  
x

x
also  
x

x
very  
x

x
wise). 
x

x
No  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
can  
x

x
resist  
x

x
the  
x

x
fascination  
x

x
of  
x

x
riddling  
x

x
talk  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
wasting  
x

x
time  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
understand  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
here  
x

x
which  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
understand  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
(though  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
you  
x

x
do,  
x

x
since  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
know  
x

x
all  
x

about  
x

x
Bilbo’s

adventures

to

which

he

was

referring),

but  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
understood  
x

x
  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
chuckled  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
inside. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
thought  
x

x
so  
x

x
last  
x

x
night,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
smiled  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
“Lake-men,  
x

x
some  
x

x
nasty

x
scheme

of

those

miserable

tub-trading

I’m

a

lizard.

I

down

that

way

for

an

age

an

age;

but  
x

I

will

soon

alter

that!”

x
“Very

x
well,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Barrel-rider!”

he  
x

said  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Maybe  
x

x
Barrel  
x

x
was  
x

your

pony’s

name;

and  
x

maybe

x
not,

though

it

was

fat

enough.

You

walk

you

all

the

way.

Let

me

tell

you

I

ate

six

ponies

eat

all

the

before

long.

I

piece

of

dwarves

help!”  
x

x
  
x

“Dwarves!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo

x
in

pretended  
x

x
  
x

x
surprise. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Don’t

x
talk  
x

x
to  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
know  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
smell  
x

x
(and  
x

x
taste)  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
—  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
better. 
x

x
Don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
tell  
x

x
me  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
eat  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf-ridden  
x

x
pony  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
it!  
x

x
You’ll  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
end,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x

with

x
such

friends,

Thief

Barrel-rider. 
x

x
I

x
don’t  
x

x
mind  
x

x
  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
go  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
tell  
x

x
them  
x

x
so  
x

x
from  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
tell  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
that  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
one  
x

x
smell  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
make  
x

x
out  
x

x
at  
x

x
all,  
x

x
hobbit-smell;  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
outside  
x

x
his  
x

x
experience  
x

x
and  
x

x
puzzled  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
mightily. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
got  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
price  
x

x
for  
x

x
that  
x

x
cup  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
night?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
on. 
x

x
“Come  
x

x
now,  
x

x
did  
x

x
you?  
x

x
  
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
at  
x

x
all!  
x

x
Well,  
x

x
that’s  
x

x
just  
x

x
like  
x

x
them. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
skulking  
x

x
outside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
job  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
dangerous  
x

x
work  
x

x
and  
x

x
get  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
when  
x

x
I’m  
x

x
not  
x

x
looking  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
them?  
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
share?  
x

x
Don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
believe  
x

x
it!  
x

x
If  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
get  
x

x
off  
x

x
alive,  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
lucky.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
really  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable. 
x

x
Whenever  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
roving  
x

x
eye,  
x

x
  
x

x
seeking  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows,  
x

x
flashed  
x

x
across  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
him,  
x

x
he  
x

x
trembled,  
x

x
and  
x

x
an  
x

x
unaccountable  
x

x
desire  
x

x
  
x

x
seized  
x

x
hold  
x

x
of  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
rush  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
reveal  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
and  
x

x
tell  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth  
x

x
to  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
grievous  
x

x
danger  
x

x
of  
x

x
coming  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon-spell. 
x

x
But  
x

x
plucking  
x

x
up  
x

x
courage  
x

x
he  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
everything,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mighty,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“Not  
x

x
gold  
x

x
alone  
x

x
brought  
x

x
us  
x

x
  
x

x
hither.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ha!  
x

x
Ha!  
x

x
You  
x

x
admit  
x

x
the  
x

x
‘us’”  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
not  
x

x
say  
x

x
‘us  
x

x
fourteen’  
x

x
and  
x

x
be  
x

x
done  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
it,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Lucky  
x

x
Number?  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
other  
x

x
business  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
parts  
x

x
  
x

x
besides  
x

x
my  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
In  
x

x
that  
x

x
case  
x

x
you  
x

x
may,  
x

x
  
x

x
perhaps,  
x

x
not  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
waste  
x

x
your  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
has  
x

x
occurred  
x

x
to  
x

x
you  
x

x
that,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
you

could

steal  
x

x
the  
x

gold  
x

x
bit  
x

x
by  
x

x
bit  
x

x
—

a

matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
years  
x

x
or  
x

x
so  
x

x
—  
x

x
you  
x

could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
it  
x

x
very  
x

x
far?  
x

x
Not  
x

x
much  
x

x
use  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-  
x

x
  
x

x
side?  
x

x
Not  
x

x
much  
x

x
use  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest?  
x

x
Bless  
x

x
me!  
x

x
  
x

x
Had  
x

x
you  
x

x
never  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
catch?  
x

x
A  
x

x
  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose,  
x

x
or  
x

x
something  
x

x
like  
x

x
it,  
x

x
  
x

x
those  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
terms,  
x

x
eh?  
x

x
But  
x

x
what  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
delivery?  
x

x
What  
x

x
about  
x

x
cartage?  
x

x
What  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
armed  
x

x
guards  
x

x
and  
x

x
tolls?”  
x

x
And  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
wily  
x

x
heart,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
his  
x

x
guesses  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
out,  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
suspected  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-men  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
plans,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
plunder  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
stop  
x

x
there  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
shore  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
young  
x

x
days  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
called  
x

x
Esgaroth. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
will  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
believe  
x

x
it,  
x

x
but  
x

x
poor  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
very  
x

x
taken  
x

x
aback. 
x

x
So  
x

x
far  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
energies  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
concentrated  
x

x
on  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
and  
x

x
finding  
x

x
the  
x

x
entrance. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
bothered  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
how  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
removed,  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
never  
x

x
how  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
might  
x

x
fall  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
share  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
back  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bag-End  
x

x
Under-Hill. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
suspicion  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
grow  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
mind  
x

x
—  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
this  
x

x
important  
x

x
  
x

x
point  
x

x
too,  
x

x
or  
x

x
were  
x

x
they  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
sleeves  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
him  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
time?  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
effect  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon-talk  
x

x
has  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
inexperienced. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
guard;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
had  
x

x
rather  
x

x
an  
x

x
overwhelming  
x

x
personality. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
tell  
x

x
you,"  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
in  
x

x
an  
x

x
effort  
x

x
to  
x

x
remain  
x

x
  
x

x
loyal  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
his  
x

x
end  
x

x
up,  
x

x
“that  
x

x
  
x

x
gold  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
an  
x

x
afterthought  
x

x
with  
x

us. 
x

We

came

over

for

Revenge. 
x

x
Surely,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
unassessably  
x

x
  
x

x
wealthy,  
x

x
you

must

realize

that

your

x
made  
x

x
you  
x

x
some  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
enemies?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
really  
x

x
did  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
devastating  
x

x
sound  
x

x
which  
x

x
shook  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
while  
x

x
far  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
together  
x

x
and  
x

x
imagined  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Revenge!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
snorted,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
lit  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
from  
x

x
floor  
x

x
to  
x

x
ceiling  
x

x
like  
x

x
scarlet  
x

x
  
x

x
lightning. 
x

x
‘‘Revenge!  
x

x
The  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
is  
x

x
dead  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
his  
x

x
kin  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
dare  
x

x
seek  
x

x
revenge?  
x

x
Girion  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
his  
x

x
people  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
wolf  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
sheep,  
x

x
and  
x

x
where  
x

x
are  
x

x
his  
x

x
sons’  
x

x
sons  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
dare  
x

x
approach  
x

x
me?  
x

x
I  
x

x
kill  
x

x
where  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
none  
x

x
dare  
x

x
resist. 
x

x
I  
x

x
laid  
x

x
low  
x

x
the  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
like  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
today. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
but  
x

x
young  
x

x
and  
x

x
tender. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
old  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
strong,  
x

x
strong,  
x

x
strong,  
x

x
Thief  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Shadows!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
gloated. 
x

x
“My  
x

x
armour  
x

x
is  
x

x
like  
x

x
tenfold  
x

x
shields,  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
teeth  
x

x
are  
x

x
swords,  
x

x
my  
x

x
claws  
x

x
spears,  
x

x
the  
x

x
shock  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
tail  
x

x
a  
x

x
thunderbolt,  
x

x
my  
x

x
wings  
x

x
a  
x

hurricane,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
my

breath  
x

x
death!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
always  
x

x
understood,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
squeak,  
x

x
“that  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
were  
x

x
softer  
x

x
  
x

x
underneath,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
region  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
—  
x

x
er  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
chest;  
x

x
but  
x

x
doubtless  
x

x
one  
x

x
so  
x

x
fortified  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
that.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
short  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
boasting. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Your  
x

x
information  
x

x
is  
x

x
antiquated,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
snapped. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
  
x

x
am  
x

x
armoured  
x

x
above  
x

x
and  
x

x
below  
x

x
with  
x

x
iron  
x

x
scales  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
hard  
x

x
gems. 
x

x
No  
x

x
blade  
x

x
can  
x

x
pierce  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
it,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Truly  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
can  
x

x
nowhere  
x

x
be  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
equal  
x

x
of  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
Impenetrable. 
x

x
What  
x

x
magnificence  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
possess  
x

x
a  
x

x
waistcoat  
x

x
of  
x

x
fine  
x

x
diamonds!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Yes,  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
rare  
x

x
and  
x

x
wonderful,  
x

x
indeed,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
absurdly  
x

x
pleased. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
had  
x

x
already  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
peculiar  
x

x
under-covering  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
previous  
x

x
visit,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
itching  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
closer  
x

x
view  
x

x
for  
x

x
reasons  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
own. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
over. 
x

x
“Look!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
say  
x

x
to  
x

x
that?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dazzlingly  
x

x
marvellous!  
x

x
Perfect!  
x

x
Flawless!  
x

x
  
x

x
Staggering!”  
x

x
exclaimed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
aloud,  
x

x
but  
x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
inside  
x

x
was:  
x

x
“Old  
x

x
fool!  
x

x
Why,  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
large  
x

x
patch  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hollow  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
left  
x

x
breast  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
bare  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
snail  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
its  
x

x
shell!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
that  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
idea  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
away. 
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
I  
x

x
really  
x

x
must  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
detain  
x

x
Your  
x

x
Magnificence  
x

x
any  
x

x
longer,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
“or  
x

x
keep  
x

x
you  
x

x
from  
x

x
much  
x

x
needed  
x

x
rest. 
x

x
Ponies  
x

x
  
x

x
take  
x

x
some  
x

x
catching,  
x

x
I  
x

x
believe,  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
start. 
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
do  
x

x
burglars,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
added  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
parting  
x

x
  
x

x
shot,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
darted  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
fled  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
unfortunate  
x

x
remark,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
spouted  
x

x
terrific  
x

x
flames  
x

x
after  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
fast  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
sped  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
slope,  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
far  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ghastly  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
was  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
opening  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
Luckily  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
jaws  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
squeeze  
x

x
in,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
nostrils  
x

x
sent  
x

x
  
x

x
forth  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
to  
x

x
pursue  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
overcome,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
blindly  
x

x
on  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
pain  
x

x
and  
x

x
fear. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
rather  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
cleverness  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
conversation  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
but  
x

x
his  
x

x
mistake  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
shook  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
into  
x

x
better  
x

x
sense. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Never  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
at  
x

x
live  
x

x
dragons,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
fool!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
became  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
favourite  
x

x
saying  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
later,  
x

x
and  
x

x
passed  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
proverb. 
x

x
‘‘You  
x

x
aren’t  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
through  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
yet,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
added,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
pretty  
x

x
  
x

x
true  
x

x
as  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
was  
x

x
turning  
x

x
into  
x

x
evening  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
faint  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
‘doorstep’. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
revived  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
doctored  
x

x
his  
x

x
scorches  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
hair  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
heels  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
properly  
x

x
again:  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
all  
x

x
been  
x

x
singed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
frizzled  
x

x
right  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
skin. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends  
x

x
did  
x

x
their  
x

x
best  
x

x
to  
x

x
cheer  
x

x
him  
x

x
up;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
eager  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
story,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
wanting  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
why  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
had  
x

x
made  
x

x
such  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
awful  
x

x
noise,  
x

x
and  
x

x
how  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
was  
x

x
worried  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
difficulty  
x

x
in  
x

x
getting  
x

x
  
x

x
anything  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
him. 
x

x
On  
x

x
thinking  
x

x
things  
x

x
over  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
regretting  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
things  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
eager  
x

x
to  
x

x
repeat  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
them. 
x

x
The  
x

x
old  
x

x
thrush  
x

x
was  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
rock  
x

x
near  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
cocked  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
side,  
x

x
listening  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
said. 
x

x
It  
x

x
shows  
x

x
what  
x

x
an  
x

x
ill  
x

x
temper  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
in:  
x

x
he  
x

x
picked  
x

x
up  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone  
x

x
and  
x

x
threw  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
thrush,  
x

x
which  
x

x
merely  
x

x
fluttered  
x

x
aside  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Drat  
x

x
the  
x

x
bird!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
crossly. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
believe  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
listening,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
look  
x

x
of  
x

x
him.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Leave  
x

x
him  
x

x
alone!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
  
x

x
thrushes  
x

x
are  
x

x
good  
x

x
and  
x

x
friendly  
x

x
—  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
bird  
x

x
indeed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
is  
x

x
maybe  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
left  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
breed  
x

x
that  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
live  
x

x
about  
x

x
here,  
x

x
tame  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
hands  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
father  
x

x
and  
x

x
grandfather. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
a  
x

x
long-lived  
x

x
and  
x

x
magical  
x

x
race,  
x

x
and  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
might  
x

x
even  
x

x
be  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
alive  
x

x
then,  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
couple  
x

x
of  
x

x
hundreds  
x

x
of  
x

x
years  
x

x
or  
x

x
more  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
Men  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
the  
x

x
trick  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
understanding  
x

x
their  
x

x
language,  
x

x
and  
x

x
used  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
to  
x

x
fly  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
elsewhere.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
he’ll  
x

x
have  
x

x
news  
x

x
to  
x

x
take  
x

x
to  
x

x
Lake-town  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
right,  
x

x
if  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
after,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo;  
x

x
  
x

x
“though  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
any  
x

x
people  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
there  
x

x
that  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
with  
x

x
thrush-language.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why  
x

x
what  
x

x
has  
x

x
happened?”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
“Do  
x

x
get  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
your  
x

x
tale!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
remember,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
confessed  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
too  
x

x
much  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
riddles  
x

x
added  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
camps  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
he  
x

x
knows  
x

x
we  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
Lake-town  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
help  
x

x
from  
x

x
there;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
horrible  
x

x
  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
his  
x

x
next  
x

x
move  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to  
x

x
goodness  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
about  
x

x
Barrel-rider;  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
make  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
blind  
x

x
rabbit  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
parts  
x

x
think  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-  
x

x
  
x

x
men.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
well!  
x

x
It  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
helped,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
difficult  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
slip  
x

x
in  
x

x
talking  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
or  
x

x
so  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
always  
x

x
heard,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
anxious  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
comfort  
x

x
him. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
think  
x

x
you  
x

x
did  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
ask  
x

x
  
x

x
me  
x

x
—  
x

x
you  
x

x
found  
x

x
out  
x

x
one  
x

x
very  
x

x
useful  
x

x
thing  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
rate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
got  
x

x
home  
x

x
alive,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
can  
x

x
say  
x

x
who  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
words  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
likes  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
It  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
mercy  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
blessing  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
bare  
x

x
patch  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
Worm’s  
x

x
  
x

x
diamond  
x

x
waistcoat.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
turned  
x

x
the  
x

x
conversation,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
discussing  
x

x
dragon-slayings  
x

x
historical,  
x

x
  
x

x
dubious,  
x

x
and  
x

x
mythical,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
various  
x

x
sorts  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
stabs  
x

x
and  
x

x
jabs  
x

x
and  
x

x
undercuts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
different  
x

x
  
x

x
arts  
x

x
devices  
x

x
and  
x

x
stratagems  
x

x
by  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
accomplished. 
x

x
The  
x

x
general  
x

x
opinion  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
catching  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
napping  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
easy  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
sounded,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
attempt  
x

x
to  
x

x
stick  
x

x
one  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
prod  
x

x
one  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
end  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
disaster  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
bold  
x

x
frontal  
x

x
attack. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
talked  
x

x
the  
x

x
thrush  
x

x
listened,  
x

x
till  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
peep  
x

x
forth,  
x

x
it  
x

x
silently  
x

x
spread  
x

x
  
x

x
its  
x

x
wings  
x

x
and  
x

x
flew  
x

x
away. 
x

x
And  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
talked  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
lengthened  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
became  
x

x
more  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
foreboding  
x

x
grew. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
interrupted  
x

x
them. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
very  
x

x
unsafe  
x

x
here,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
point  
x

x
of  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
here. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
withered  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
green,  
x

x
and  
x

x
anyway  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
has  
x

x
come  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
bones  
x

x
that  
x

x
this  
x

x
place  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
attacked  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
knows  
x

x
now  
x

x
how  
x

x
I  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
trust  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
guess  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
is. 
x

x
He  
x

x
will  
x

x
break  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
to  
x

x
bits,  
x

x
if  
x

x
necessary,  
x

x
to  
x

x
stop  
x

x
up  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
entrance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
with  
x

x
it  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
better  
x

x
he  
x

x
will  
x

x
like  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
very  
x

x
gloomy,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
has  
x

x
not  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
  
x

x
end,  
x

x
then,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
so  
x

x
eager  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
us  
x

x
out?  
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
not,  
x

x
or  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
him.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know,  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
—  
x

x
because  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
try  
x

x
and  
x

x
lure  
x

x
me  
x

x
in  
x

x
again,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose,  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
because  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
till  
x

x
after  
x

x
tonight’s  
x

x
hunt,  
x

x
or  
x

x
because  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
damage  
x

x
his  
x

x
bedroom  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
help  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
argue. 
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
coming  
x

x
out  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
minute  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
hope  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
well  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
and  
x

x
shut  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
door.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
so  
x

x
much  
x

x
in  
x

x
earnest  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
did  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
though  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
delayed  
x

x
shutting  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
plan,  
x

x
for  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
knew  
x

x
whether  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
how  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
it  
x

x
open  
x

x
again  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
inside,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
being  
x

x
shut  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
place  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
led  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
lair  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
one  
x

x
they  
x

x
liked. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
  
x

x
everything  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
quite  
x

x
quiet,  
x

x
both  
x

x
outside  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
So  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
longish  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
sat  
x

x
inside  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
half-open  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
talking. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
talk  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
wicked  
x

x
  
x

x
words  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
wished  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
heard  
x

x
them,  
x

x
or  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
feel  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
certain  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
now  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
absolutely  
x

x
honest  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
declared  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
thought  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
about  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
happen  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
won. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
venture,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
we  
x

x
know  
x

x
that  
x

x
still;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
still  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
won  
x

x
it  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
time  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
what  
x

x
to  
x

x
do  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
your  
x

x
share,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
I  
x

x
assure  
x

x
you  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
grateful  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
shall  
x

x
choose  
x

x
your  
x

x
own  
x

x
fourteenth,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
anything  
x

x
to  
x

x
divide. 
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
worried  
x

x
about  
x

x
transport,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
admit  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
difficulties  
x

x
are  
x

x
great  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
become  
x

x
less  
x

x
wild  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
passing  
x

x
of  
x

x
time,  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
the  
x

x
reverse  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
do  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
for  
x

x
you,  
x

x
and  
x

x
take  
x

x
our  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cost  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
comes. 
x

x
Believe  
x

x
me  
x

x
or  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
like!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
From  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
talk  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
  
x

x
itself  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
things  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
remembered. 
x

x
They  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
lying  
x

x
there  
x

x
unharmed  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
below:  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
spears  
x

x
that  
x

x
were  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
armies  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
King  
x

x
Bladorthin  
x

x
(long  
x

x
since  
x

x
dead),  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
thrice-forged  
x

x
head  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
shafts  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
inlaid  
x

x
with  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
delivered  
x

x
or  
x

x
paid  
x

x
for;  
x

x
shields  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
dead;  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
golden  
x

x
cup  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thror,  
x

x
two-  
x

x

handed,

hammered

carven  
x

x
with  
x

x
birds

and  
x

x
  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
whose  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
and  
x

x
petals  
x

x
were  
x

x
of

x
jewels;

x
  
x

x
coats  
x

x
of  
x

x
mail  
x

x
gilded  
x

x
and  
x

x
silvered  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
impenetrable;  
x

x
the  
x

x
necklace  
x

x
of  
x

x
Girion,  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
five  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
emeralds  
x

x
green  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
arming  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eldest  
x

x
son  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
coat  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarf-linked  
x

x
rings  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
had  
x

x
never  
x

x
been  
x

x
made  
x

x
before,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
wrought  
x

x
of  
x

x
pure  
x

x
silver  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
power  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
strength  
x

x
of  
x

x
triple  
x

x
steel. 
x

x
But  
x

x
fairest  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
white  
x

x
gem,  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
roots  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
Arkenstone!  
x

x
The  
x

x
Arkenstone!”  
x

x
  
x

x
murmured  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
half  
x

x
dreaming  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
chin  
x

x
upon  
x

x
his  
x

x
knees. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
globe  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
facets;  
x

x
it  
x

x
shone  
x

x
like  
x

x
silver  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
firelight,  
x

x
like  
x

x
water  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun,  
x

x
like  
x

x
snow  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars,  
x

x
like  
x

x
rain  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
Moon!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
enchanted  
x

x
desire  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
from  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
All  
x

x
through  
x

x
their  
x

x
talk  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
half  
x

x
listening  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
sat  
x

x
nearest  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door  
x

x
with  
x

x
one  
x

x
ear  
x

x
cocked  
x

x
for  
x

x
any  
x

x
beginnings  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
sound  
x

x
without,  
x

x
his  
x

x
other  
x

x
was  
x

x
alert  
x

x
for  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
murmurs  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
for  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
whisper  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
movement  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Darkness  
x

x
grew  
x

x
deeper  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
grew  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
uneasy. 
x

x
“Shut  
x

x
the  
x

x
door!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
begged  
x

x
them,  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
fear  
x

x
that  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
marrow. 
x

x
I  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
silence  
x

x
far  
x

x
less  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
uproar  
x

x
of  
x

x
last  
x

x
night. 
x

x
  
x

x
Shut  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
before  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
too  
x

x
late!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Something  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice  
x

x
gave  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
feeling. 
x

x
Slowly  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
shook  
x

x
  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
and  
x

x
getting  
x

x
up  
x

x
he  
x

x
kicked  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone  
x

x
that  
x

x
wedged  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
  
x

x
upon  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
closed  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
snap  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
clang. 
x

x
  
x

x
No  
x

x
trace  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
keyhole  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
left  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
inside. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
shut  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
too  
x

x
soon. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
gone  
x

x
any  
x

x
distance  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
blow  
x

x
smote  
x

x
the  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
crash  
x

x
of  
x

x
battering-rams  
x

x
made  
x

x
of  
x

x
forest  
x

x
oaks  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
swung  
x

x
by  
x

x
giants. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rock  
x

x
boomed,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
walls  
x

x
cracked  
x

x
and  
x

x
stones  
x

x
fell  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads. 
x

x
What  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
happened  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
door  
x

x
had  
x

x
still  
x

x
been  
x

x
open  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
to  
x

x
think. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
fled  
x

x
further  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
glad  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
alive,  
x

x
while  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
outside  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
roar  
x

x
and  
x

x
rumble  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
fury. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
breaking  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
to  
x

x
pieces,  
x

x
smashing  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
lashings  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
huge  
x

x
tail,  
x

x
till  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
lofty  
x

x
camping  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
the  
x

x
scorched  
x

x
grass,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
thrush’s  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
the  
x

x
snail-covered  
x

x
walls,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
ledge,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
disappeared  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
jumble  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
smithereens,  
x

x
and  
x

x
an  
x

x
avalanche  
x

x
of  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
  
x

x
stones  
x

x
fell  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
his  
x

x
lair  
x

x
in  
x

x
silent  
x

x
stealth,  
x

x
  
x

x
quietly  
x

x
soared  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
floated  
x

x
  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
and  
x

x
slow  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
monstrous  
x

x
  
x

x
crow,  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
west  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
of  
x

x
catching  
x

x
unawares  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
or  
x

x
somebody  
x

x
there,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
spying  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
outlet  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
passage  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
thief  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
used. 
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
outburst  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
find  
x

x
nobody  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
the  
x

x
outlet  
x

x
must  
x

x
actually  
x

x
be. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
let  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
rage  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
better  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
troubled  
x

x
again  
x

x
from  
x

x
that  
x

x
direction. 
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
further  
x

x
vengeance  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
take. 
x

x
“Barrel-rider!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
snorted. 
x

x
“Your  
x

x
feet  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
waterside  
x

x
and  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
you  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
doubt. 
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
your  
x

x
smell,  
x

x
but  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
their  
x

x
help. 
x

x
They  
x

x
shall  
x

x
see  
x

x
me  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
who  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
real  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
rose  
x

x
in  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
away  
x

x
south  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River.

NOT

AT

HOME  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the

meanwhile,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
sat  
x

x
in  
x

x
darkness,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
utter  
x

x
silence  
x

x
fell  
x

x
about  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Little  
x

x
they  
x

x
ate  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
little  
x

x
they  
x

x
spoke. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
count  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
passing  
x

x
of  
x

x
time;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
scarcely  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
move,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
whisper  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
voices  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
rustled  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

tunnel. 
x

x
If  
x

x
they  
x

x
dozed,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
woke  
x

x
still  
x

x
to  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
silence  
x

x
going  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
unbroken. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
after  
x

x
days  
x

x
and  
x

x
days  
x

x
of  
x

x
waiting,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
becoming  
x

x
  
x

x
choked  
x

x
and  
x

x
dazed  
x

x
for  
x

x
want  
x

x
of  
x

x
air,  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
bear  
x

x
it  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
They  
x

x
would  
x

x
almost  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
welcomed  
x

x
sounds  
x

x
from  
x

x
below  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
  
x

x
return. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
silence  
x

x
they  
x

x
feared  
x

x
some  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
  
x

x
devilry  
x

x
of  
x

x
his,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they

could  
x

x
not  
x

x
sit  
x

x
there  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
ever. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
spoke:  
x

x
“Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
try  
x

x
the  
x

x
door!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
must  
x

x
feel  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
face  
x

x
soon

x
or  
x

x
die. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
rather  
x

x
be  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
by  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
open  
x

x
than  
x

x
suffocate  
x

x
in  
x

x
here!”  
x

x
So  
x

x
several  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
got  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
groped  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
had  
x

x
been. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
upper  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
shattered  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
with  
x

x
broken  
x

x
rock. 
x

x
Neither  
x

x
key  
x

x
nor  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
once  
x

x
obeyed  
x

x
would  
x

x
ever  
x

x
open  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
door  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
trapped!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
groaned. 
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
end. 
x

x
We  
x

x
shall  
x

x
die  
x

x
here.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
somehow,  
x

x
just  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
despairing,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
felt  
x

x
a  
x

x
strange  
x

x
lightening  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
a  
x

x
heavyweight  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
his  
x

x
waistcoat. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come,  
x

x
come!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
‘“While  
x

x
there’s  
x

x
life  
x

x
  
x

x
there’s  
x

x
hope!’  
x

x
as  
x

x
my  
x

x
father  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Third  
x

x
time  
x

x
pays  
x

x
for  
x

x
all.’  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
going  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
once  
x

x
again. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
twice,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
knew  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
end,  
x

x
so  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
risk  
x

x
a  
x

x
third  
x

x
visit  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
longer  
x

x
sure. 
x

x
Anyway  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
way  
x

x
out  
x

x
is  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
you  
x

x
had  
x

x
better  
x

x
all  
x

x
come  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
desperation  
x

x
they  
x

x
agreed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
forward  
x

x
by  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
side. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Now  
x

x
do  
x

x
be  
x

x
careful!”  
x

x
whispered  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit,  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
as  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
be!  
x

x
There  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom,  
x

x
but  
x

x
then  
x

x
again  
x

x
there  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
be. 
x

x
Don’t  
x

x
let  
x

x
us  
x

x
take  
x

x
any  
x

x
unnecessary  
x

x
risks!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down,  
x

x
down  
x

x
they  
x

x
went. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
compare  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
in  
x

x
real  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
stealth,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
puffing  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
shuffling  
x

x
which  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
magnified  
x

x
alarmingly;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
though  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
in  
x

x
fear  
x

x
  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
and  
x

x
listened,  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
sound  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
  
x

x
below. 
x

x
Near  
x

x
the  
x

x
bottom,  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
judge,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
ahead. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
need  
x

x
it:  
x

x
the  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
complete,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
all  
x

x
invisible,  
x

x
ring  
x

x
or  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
In  
x

x
fact  
x

x
so  
x

x
black  
x

x
was  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening  
x

x
unexpectedly,  
x

x
put  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
air,  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
forward,  
x

x
and  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
headlong  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
face  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
dare  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
up,  
x

x
or  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
even  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
breathe. 
x

x
But  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
moved. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
of  
x

x
light  
x

x
—  
x

x
unless,  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
raised  
x

x
his  
x

x
head,  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
pale  
x

x
white  
x

x
glint,  
x

x
above  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom. 
x

x
But  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
spark  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon-fire,  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
worm-stench  
x

x
was  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
place,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
taste  
x

x
of  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
tongue. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
length  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
could  
x

x
bear  
x

x
it  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
longer. 
x

x
“Confound  
x

x
you,  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
you  
x

x
worm!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
squeaked  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
“Stop  
x

x
playing  
x

x
hide-and-seek!  
x

x
  
x

x
Give  
x

x
me  
x

x
a  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
eat  
x

x
me,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
catch  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Faint  
x

x
echoes  
x

x
ran  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
unseen  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
answer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
got  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
what  
x

x
direction  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
what  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
playing  
x

x
at,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
home  
x

x
today  
x

x
  
x

x
(or  
x

x
tonight,  
x

x
or  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
it  
x

x
is),  
x

x
I  
x

x
do  
x

x
believe. 
x

x
If  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
lost  
x

x
their  
x

x
tinder-boxes,  
x

x
  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
look  
x

x
round  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
luck  
x

x
turns.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Light!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“Can  
x

x
anybody  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
light?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
were  
x

x
very  
x

x
alarmed  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
fell  
x

x
forward  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
step  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
bump  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
just  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Sh!  
x

x
sh!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
hissed,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
heard  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
voice;  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
that  
x

x
helped  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
where  
x

x
they  
x

x
were,  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
some  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
get  
x

x
anything  
x

x
else  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
them. 
x

x
But  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
end,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
actually  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
stamp  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor,  
x

x
and  
x

x
screamed  
x

x
out  
x

x
“light!”  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
shrill  
x

x
voice,  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
gave  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
were  
x

x
sent  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
bundles  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
a  
x

x
twinkling  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
showed  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
returning,  
x

x
Oin  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
pine-torch  
x

x
alight  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bundle  
x

x
of  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
his  
x

x
arm. 
x

x
Quickly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
trotted  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
took  
x

x
the  
x

x
torch;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
persuade  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
to  
x

x
light  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
join  
x

x
him  
x

x
yet. 
x

x
As  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
explained,  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
officially  
x

x
their  
x

x
expert  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
investigator. 
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
risk  
x

x
a  
x

x
light,  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
affair. 
x

x
They  
x

x
would  
x

x
wait  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
report. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
sat  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
watched. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
little  
x

x
dark  
x

x
shape  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
  
x

x
start  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
holding  
x

x
his  
x

x
tiny  
x

x
light  
x

x
aloft. 
x

x
  
x

x
Every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
again,  
x

x
while  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
near  
x

x
  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
they  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
glint  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
tinkle  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
on  
x

x
some  
x

x
golden  
x

x
thing. 
x

x
The  
x

x
light  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
smaller  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
wandered  
x

x
away  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
vast  
x

x
hall;  
x

x
  
x

x
then  
x

x
it  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
rise  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
mound  
x

x
of  
x

x
treasure. 
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
top,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
went  
x

x
on. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
him  
x

x
halt  
x

x
and  
x

x
stoop  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
know  
x

x
the  
x

x
reason. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
So  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
from  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

x
  
x

x
description;  
x

x
but  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
there  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
two  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
gems,  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
so  
x

x
marvellous  
x

x
a  
x

x
hoard,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
world. 
x

x
Ever  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
climbed,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
white  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
had  
x

x
shone  
x

x
before  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet  
x

x
towards  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Slowly  
x

x
it  
x

x
grew  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
globe  
x

x
of  
x

x
pallid  
x

x
light. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
near,  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
tinged  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
flickering  
x

x
sparkle  
x

x
of  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
colours  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
surface,  
x

x
reflected  
x

x
and  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wavering  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
torch. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
down  
x

x
upon  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
caught  
x

x
his  
x

x
breath. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
great  
x

x
jewel  
x

x
shone  
x

x
before  
x

x
his  
x

x
feet  
x

x
of  
x

x
its  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
inner  
x

x
light,  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
cut  
x

x
and  
x

x
fashioned  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
dug  
x

x
it  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago,  
x

x
it  
x

x
took  
x

x
all  
x

x
light  
x

x
that  
x

x
fell  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
changed  
x

x
it  
x

x
into  
x

x
ten  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
white  
x

x
radiance  
x

x
shot  
x

x
with  
x

x
glints  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
rainbow. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
arm  
x

x
went  
x

x
towards  
x

x
it  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
its  
x

x
enchantment. 
x

x
His  
x

x
small  
x

x
hand  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
close  
x

x
about  
x

x
it,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
and  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
gem;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
it,  
x

x
shut  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
deepest  
x

x
pocket. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
indeed!”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
I  
x

x
must  
x

x
tell  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
about  
x

x
it  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
time. 
x

x
They  
x

x
did  
x

x
say  
x

x
I  
x

x
could  
x

x
pick  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
choose  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
share;  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
choose  
x

x
this,  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest!”  
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
an  
x

x
uncomfortable  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
picking  
x

x
and  
x

x
choosing  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
really  
x

x
been  
x

x
meant  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
include  
x

x
this  
x

x
marvellous  
x

x
gem,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
yet  
x

x
come  
x

x
of  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Down  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
mound  
x

x
he  
x

x
climbed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
spark  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
torch  
x

x
vanished  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
watching  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
But  
x

x
soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
it  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
distance  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
crossing  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
went  
x

x
on,  
x

x
until  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
further  
x

x
side,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
a  
x

x
draught  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
air  
x

x
refreshed  
x

x
him,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
almost  
x

x
puffed  
x

x
out  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
light. 
x

x
He  
x

x
peeped  
x

x
timidly  
x

x
through,  
x

x
and  
x

x
caught  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
glimpse  
x

x
of  
x

x
great  
x

x
passages  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dim  
x

x
  
x

x
beginnings  
x

x
of  
x

x
wide  
x

x
stairs  
x

x
going  
x

x
up  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
gloom. 
x

x
And  
x

x
still  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
sight  
x

x
nor  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
turn  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
back,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
a  
x

x
black  
x

x
shape  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
at  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
brushed  
x

x
his  
x

x
face. 
x

x
He  
x

x
squeaked  
x

x
and  
x

x
started,  
x

x
  
x

x
stumbled  
x

x
backwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
His  
x

x
torch  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
  
x

x
head  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
out!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Only  
x

x
a  
x

x
bat,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
and  
x

x
hope!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
miserably. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
now  
x

x
what  
x

x
am  
x

x
I  
x

x
to  
x

x
do?  
x

x
Which  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
East,  
x

x
South,  
x

x
North,  
x

x
or  
x

x
West?”  
x

x

x
  
x

x
“Thorin!  
x

x
Balin!  
x

x
Oin!  
x

x
Gloin!  
x

x
Fili!  
x

x
Kili!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
loud  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
a  
x

x
thin  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
noise  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wide  
x

x
blackness. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
light’s  
x

x
gone  
x

x
  
x

x
out!  
x

x
Someone  
x

x
come  
x

x
and  
x

x
find  
x

x
me  
x

x
and  
x

x
help  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
his  
x

x
courage  
x

x
had  
x

x
failed  
x

x
  
x

x
altogether. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Faintly  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
heard  
x

x
his  
x

x
small  
x

x
cries,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
word  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
catch  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
“help!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Now  
x

x
what  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
or  
x

x
under  
x

x
it  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
happened?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“Certainly  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
or  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
squeaking.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
waited  
x

x
a  
x

x
moment  
x

x
or  
x

x
two,  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
dragon-noises,  
x

x
no  
x

x
sound  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
distant  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“Come,  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
you,  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
another  
x

x
light  
x

x
or  
x

x
two!”  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
ordered. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
  
x

x
seems  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
and  
x

x
help  
x

x
our  
x

x
burglar.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
about  
x

x
our  
x

x
turn  
x

x
to  
x

x
help,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
quite  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
go. 
x

x
Anyway  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
safe  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gloin  
x

x
lit  
x

x
several  
x

x
more  
x

x
torches,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
crept  
x

x
out,  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one,  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wall  
x

x
as  
x

x
hurriedly  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
could. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
met  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
himself  
x

x
coming  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them. 
x

x
His  
x

x
wits  
x

x
had  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
returned  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
twinkle  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
lights. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Only  
x

x
a  
x

x
bat  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
dropped  
x

x
torch,  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
  
x

x
worse!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
in  
x

x
answer  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
questions. 
x

x
  
x

x
Though  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
much  
x

x
relieved,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
inclined  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
grumpy  
x

x
at  
x

x
being  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing;  
x

x
but  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
said,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
told  
x

x
them  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Arkenstone,  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know. 
x

x
The  
x

x
mere  
x

x
fleeting  
x

x
  
x

x
glimpses  
x

x
of  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
caught  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
along  
x

x
had  
x

x
rekindled  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarvish  
x

x
hearts;  
x

x
and  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
respectable,  
x

x
is  
x

x
wakened  
x

x
by  
x

x
gold  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
he  
x

x
grows  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
bold,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
become  
x

x
fierce. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
needed  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
urging. 
x

x
All  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
eager  
x

x
to  
x

x
explore  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
chance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
  
x

x
that,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
present,  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
was  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
home. 
x

x
Each  
x

x
now  
x

x
gripped  
x

x
a  
x

x
lighted  
x

x
torch;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
gazed,  
x

x
first  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
side  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
another,  
x

x
they  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
fear  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
caution. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
aloud,  
x

x
and  
x

x
cried  
x

x
out  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
another,  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
old  
x

x
treasures  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mound  
x

x
or  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
held  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
light,  
x

x
caressing  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fingering  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
were  
x

x
almost  
x

x
in  
x

x
merry  
x

x
mood,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
finding  
x

x
still  
x

x
hanging  
x

x
there  
x

x
many  
x

x
golden  
x

x
  
x

x
harps  
x

x
strung  
x

x
with  
x

x
silver  
x

x
they  
x

x
took  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
struck  
x

x
them;  
x

x
and  
x

x
being  
x

x
magical  
x

x
(and  
x

x
also  
x

x
  
x

x
untouched  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
interest  
x

x
in  
x

x
music)  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
in  
x

x
tune. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
dark  
x

x
hall  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
melody  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
silent. 
x

x
But  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
practical:  
x

x
they  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
gems  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuffed  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
pockets,  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
carry  
x

x
fall  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
through  
x

x
their  
x

x
fingers  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
sigh. 
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
least  
x

x
among  
x

x
these;  
x

x
but  
x

x
always  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
searched  
x

x
from  
x

x
side  
x

x
to  
x

x
side  
x

x
for  
x

x
something  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
find. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
yet  
x

x
to  
x

x
no  
x

x
one. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
took  
x

x
down  
x

x
mail  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
weapons  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
walls,  
x

x
and  
x

x
armed  
x

x
  
x

x
themselves. 
x

x
Royal  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
did  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
look,  
x

x
clad  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
coat  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold-plated  
x

x
rings,  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
silver-  
x

x
  
x

x
hafted  
x

x
axe  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
belt  
x

x
crusted  
x

x
with  
x

x
scarlet  
x

x
stones. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Mr. 
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“Here  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
  
x

x
payment  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
reward!  
x

x
Cast  
x

x
off  
x

x
your  
x

x
old  
x

x
coat  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
put  
x

x
on  
x

x
this!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
on  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
coat  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
mail,  
x

x
wrought  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
young  
x

x
elf-prince  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
of  
x

x
silver-steel,  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
call  
x

x
  
x

x
mithril,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
it  
x

x
went  
x

x
a  
x

x
belt  
x

x
of  
x

x
pearls  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
crystals. 
x

x
A  
x

x
light  
x

x
helm  
x

x
of  
x

x
figured  
x

x
leather,  
x

x
  
x

x
strengthened  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
with  
x

x
hoops  
x

x
of  
x

x
steel,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
studded  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
brim  
x

x
with  
x

x
white  
x

x
gems,  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
set  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit’s  
x

x
head. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
magnificent,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
I  
x

x
expect  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
look  
x

x
rather  
x

x
absurd. 
x

x
How  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
laugh  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
at  
x

x
home!  
x

x
Still  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
looking-  
x

x
  
x

x
glass  
x

x
handy!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
kept  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
clear  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
bewitchment  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
did. 
x

x
Long  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
tired  
x

x
of  
x

x
examining  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasures,  
x

x
he  
x

x
became  
x

x
  
x

x
weary  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
nervously  
x

x
what  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
would  
x

x
give  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
precious  
x

x
goblets,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
“for  
x

x
a  
x

x
drink  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
cheering  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
bowls!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thorin!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried  
x

x
aloud. 
x

x
“What  
x

x
next?  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
armed,  
x

x
but  
x

x
what  
x

x
good  
x

x
has  
x

x
any  
x

x
armour  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
before  
x

x
against  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dreadful?  
x

x
This  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
won  
x

x
back. 
x

x
We  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
looking  
x

x
for  
x

x
gold  
x

x
yet,  
x

x
but  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
way  
x

x
of  
x

x
escape;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
tempted  
x

x
luck  
x

x
too  
x

x
long!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
speak  
x

x
the  
x

x
truth!”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
  
x

x
recovering  
x

x
his  
x

x
wits. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
go!  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
guide  
x

x
you. 
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
years  
x

x
should  
x

x
I  
x

x
forget  
x

x
the  
x

x
ways  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
palace.”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
the  
x

x
others,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
together,  
x

x
and  
x

x
holding  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
torches  
x

x
above  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
they  
x

x
passed  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
gaping  
x

x
doors,  
x

x
not  
x

x
without  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
backward  
x

x
  
x

x
glance  
x

x
of  
x

x
longing. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
glittering  
x

x
mail  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
covered  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
old  
x

x
cloaks  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
bright  
x

x
helms  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
tattered  
x

x
hoods,  
x

x
and  
x

x
one  
x

x
by  
x

x
one  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
walked  
x

x
behind  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
a  
x

x
line  
x

x
of  
x

x
little  
x

x
lights  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
that  
x

x
halted  
x

x
often,  
x

x
listening  
x

x
in  
x

x
fear  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
for  
x

x
any  
x

x
rumour  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
coming. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Though  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
adornments  
x

x
were  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
mouldered  
x

x
or  
x

x
destroyed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
all  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
befouled  
x

x
and  
x

x
blasted  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
comings  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
goings  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
monster,  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
knew  
x

x
every  
x

x
  
x

x
passage  
x

x
and  
x

x
every  
x

x
turn. 
x

x
They  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
stairs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
went  
x

x
down  
x

x
wide  
x

x
echoing  
x

x
  
x

x
ways,  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
yet  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
stairs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
more  
x

x
stairs  
x

x
again. 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
smooth,  
x

x
cut  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
living  
x

x
rock  
x

x
broad  
x

x
and  
x

x
fair;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
up,  
x

x
up,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
went,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
met  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
any  
x

x
living  
x

x
thing,  
x

x
only  
x

x
furtive  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
fled  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
approach  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
torches  
x

x
fluttering  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
draughts. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
steps  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
made,  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit-legs,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
go  
x

x
on  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer,  
x

x
when  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
high  
x

x
and  
x

x
far  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
the  
x

x
reach  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
torch-light. 
x

x
A  
x

x
white  
x

x
glimmer  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
through  
x

x
some  
x

x
opening  
x

x
far  
x

x
above,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
smelt  
x

x
sweeter. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
them  
x

x
light  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
dimly  
x

x
through  
x

x
great  
x

x
doors,  
x

x
that  
x

x
hung  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
hinges  
x

x
and  
x

x
half  
x

x
burnt. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
chamber  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thror,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin;  
x

x
“the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
of  
x

x
feasting  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
council. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
now  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
passed  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruined  
x

x
chamber. 
x

x
  
x

x
Tables  
x

x
were  
x

x
rotting  
x

x
there;  
x

x
chairs  
x

x
and  
x

x
benches  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
lying  
x

x
there  
x

x
overturned,  
x

x
charred  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
decaying. 
x

x
Skulls  
x

x
and  
x

x
bones  
x

x
were  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
flagons  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowls  
x

x
and  
x

x
broken  
x

x
drinking-  
x

x
  
x

x
horns  
x

x
and  
x

x
dust. 
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
through  
x

x
yet  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
doors  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
further  
x

x
end,  
x

x
a  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
water  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
upon  
x

x
their  
x

x
ears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
grey  
x

x
light  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
more  
x

x
full. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
birth  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“From  
x

x
here  
x

x
it  
x

x
hastens  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
  
x

x
Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
follow  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Out  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
opening  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
wall  
x

x
of  
x

x
rock  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
issued  
x

x
a  
x

x
boiling  
x

x
water,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
flowed  
x

x
swirling  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
channel,  
x

x
carved  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
straight  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
deep  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
cunning  
x

x
of  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
hands. 
x

x
  
x

x
Beside  
x

x
it  
x

x
ran  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone-paved  
x

x
road,  
x

x
wide  
x

x
enough  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
men  
x

x
abreast. 
x

x
Swiftly  
x

x
along  
x

x
this  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
ran,  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide-sweeping  
x

x
turn  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
behold!  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
stood  
x

x
the  
x

x
broad  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
day. 
x

x
In  
x

x
front  
x

x
there  
x

x
rose  
x

x
a  
x

x
tall  
x

x
arch,  
x

x
still  
x

x
showing  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
fragments  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
carven  
x

x
work  
x

x
within,  
x

x
worn  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
and  
x

x
blackened  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
was. 
x

x
A  
x

x
  
x

x
misty  
x

x
sun  
x

x
sent  
x

x
its  
x

x
pale  
x

x
light  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
beams  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
fell  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
pavement  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
threshold. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
whirl  
x

x
of  
x

x
bats  
x

x
frightened  
x

x
from  
x

x
slumber  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
smoking  
x

x
torches  
x

x
flurried  
x

x
over  
x

x
them;  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
forward  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
slithered  
x

x
on  
x

x
stones  
x

x
  
x

x
rubbed  
x

x
smooth  
x

x
and  
x

x
slimed  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
passing  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
fell  
x

x
  
x

x
noisily  
x

x
outward  
x

x
and  
x

x
foamed  
x

x
down  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
They  
x

x
flung  
x

x
their  
x

x
pale  
x

x
torches  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
dazzled  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
looking  
x

x
out  
x

x
upon  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“I  
x

x
never  
x

x
expected  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
looking  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
door. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
expected  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
so  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
feel  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
on  
x

x
my  
x

x
face. 
x

x
But,  
x

x
ow!  
x

x
this  
x

x
wind  
x

x
is  
x

x
cold!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was. 
x

x
A  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
easterly  
x

x
breeze  
x

x
blew  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
threat  
x

x
of  
x

x
oncoming  
x

x
winter. 
x

x
It  
x

x
swirled  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
sighed  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks. 
x

x
After  
x

x
their  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
time  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
stewing  
x

x
depths  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon-  
x

x
  
x

x
haunted  
x

x
caverns,  
x

x
they  
x

x
shivered  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
sun. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
realized  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
only  
x

x
  
x

x
tired  
x

x
but  
x

x
also  
x

x
very  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
indeed. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
seems  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
late  
x

x
morning,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
‘‘and  
x

x
so  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less  
x

x
breakfast-time  
x

x
—  
x

x
if  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
to  
x

x
have. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
feel  
x

x
that  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
  
x

x
front  
x

x
doorstep  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
safest  
x

x
place  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
meal. 
x

x
Do  
x

x
  
x

x
let’s  
x

x
go  
x

x
somewhere  
x

x
where  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
sit  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
bit!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Quite  
x

x
right!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
I  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
which  
x

x
way  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
go:  
x

x
we  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
look-out  
x

x
post  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
South-West  
x

x
corner  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“How  
x

x
far  
x

x
is  
x

x
that?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Five  
x

x
hours  
x

x
march,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
think. 
x

x
It  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
rough  
x

x
going. 
x

x
The  
x

x
road  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
left  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
seems  
x

x
all  
x

x
broken  
x

x
up. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
look  
x

x
down  
x

x
there!  
x

x
The  
x

x
river  
x

x
loops  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
east  
x

x
  
x

x
across  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruined  
x

x
town. 
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
point  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
once  
x

x
a  
x

x
bridge,  
x

x
leading  
x

x
to  
x

x
steep  
x

x
  
x

x
stairs  
x

x
that  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
road  
x

x
running  
x

x
towards  
x

x
Ravenhill. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
(or  
x

x
  
x

x
was)  
x

x
a  
x

x
path  
x

x
that  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
and  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
post. 
x

x
A  
x

x
hard  
x

x
climb,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
steps  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
still  
x

x
there.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dear  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
grumbled  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
“More  
x

x
  
x

x
walking  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
without  
x

x
breakfast!  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
how  
x

x
many  
x

x
breakfasts,  
x

x
and  
x

x
other  
x

x
meals,  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
missed  
x

x
inside  
x

x
that  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
clockless,  
x

x
  
x

x
timeless  
x

x
hole?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
two  
x

x
nights  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
day  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
by  
x

x
(and  
x

x
not  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
food)  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
magic  
x

x
door,  
x

x
but  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
quite  
x

x
lost  
x

x
count,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
one  
x

x
night  
x

x
or  
x

x
a  
x

x
week  
x

x
of  
x

x
nights  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
tell. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come,  
x

x
come!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
laughing  
x

x
—  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
spirits  
x

x
had  
x

x
begun  
x

x
to  
x

x
rise  
x

x
again,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
rattled  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
precious  
x

x
stones  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
pockets. 
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
call  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
palace  
x

x
a  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
hole!  
x

x
You  
x

x
wait  
x

x
till  
x

x
it  
x

x
has  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
cleaned  
x

x
and  
x

x
redecorated!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
won’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
till  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
dead,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
glumly. 
x

x
“In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
where  
x

x
is  
x

x
he?  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
give  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
to  
x

x
know. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
up  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
looking  
x

x
down  
x

x
at  
x

x
us!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
idea  
x

x
disturbed  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
mightily,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
decided  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
right. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
must  
x

x
move  
x

x
away  
x

x
from  
x

x
here,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dori. 
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
back  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
head.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It’s  
x

x
a  
x

x
cold  
x

x
lonesome  
x

x
place,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bombur. 
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
drink,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
see  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
food. 
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
would  
x

x
always  
x

x
be  
x

x
hungry  
x

x
in  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
parts.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
on!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
on!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
“Let  
x

x
  
x

x
us  
x

x
follow  
x

x
Balin’s  
x

x
path!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Under  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
wall  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
path,  
x

x
so  
x

x
on  
x

x
they  
x

x
trudged  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
stones  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
emptiness  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
desolation  
x

x
soon  
x

x
sobered  
x

x
even  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
that  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
had  
x

x
spoken  
x

x
of  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
fallen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
its  
x

x
stones  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
boulders  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
noisy  
x

x
stream;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
forded  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
without  
x

x
much  
x

x
difficulty,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
steps,  
x

x
and  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
After  
x

x
going  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
struck  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
road,  
x

x
and  
x

x
before  
x

x
long  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep  
x

x
  
x

x
dell  
x

x
sheltered  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks;  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
rested  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
breakfast  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could,  
x

x
chiefly  
x

x
cram  
x

x
and  
x

x
water. 
x

x
(If  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
know  
x

x
what  
x

x
cram  
x

x
is,  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
only  
x

x
say  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
the  
x

x
recipe;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
biscuitish,  
x

x
keeps  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
indefinitely,  
x

x
is  
x

x
supposed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
sustaining,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
certainly  
x

x
not  
x

x
entertaining,  
x

x
being  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
uninteresting  
x

x
except  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
chewing  
x

x
exercise. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-men  
x

x
for  
x

x
long  
x

x
journeys.)  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
again;  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
road  
x

x
struck  
x

x
westwards  
x

x
and  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
shoulder  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
south-pointing  
x

x
mountain-  
x

x
  
x

x
spur  
x

x
drew  
x

x
ever  
x

x
nearer. 
x

x
At  
x

x
length  
x

x
they  
x

x
reached  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hill  
x

x
path. 
x

x
It  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
steeply  
x

x
up,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
plodded  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
one  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
other,  
x

x
till  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
late  
x

x
afternoon  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ridqe  
x

x
and  
x

x
saw  
x

x
the  
x

x
wintry  
x

x
sun  
x

x
qoinq  
x

x
downwards  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
West. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
flat  
x

x
place  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
wall  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
three  
x

x
sides,  
x

x
but  
x

x
backed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
face  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
opening  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
door. 
x

x
From  
x

x
that  
x

x
door  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
view  
x

x
  
x

x
East  
x

x
and  
x

x
South  
x

x
and  
x

x
West. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Here,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
“in  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
days  
x

x
we  
x

x
used  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
to  
x

x
keep  
x

x
watchmen,  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
door  
x

x
behind  
x

x
  
x

x
leads  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
rockhewn  
x

x
chamber  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
here  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
guardroom. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
several  
x

x
  
x

x
places  
x

x
like  
x

x
it  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
small  
x

x
need  
x

x
for  
x

x
watching  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

x
prosperity,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
guards  
x

x
were  
x

x
made  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
comfortable,  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
—  
x

x
otherwise  
x

x
we  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
longer  
x

x
warning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
coming  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
and  
x

x
things  
x

x
might  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
different. 
x

x
  
x

x
Still,  
x

x
here  
x

x
we  
x

x
can  
x

x
now  
x

x
lie  
x

x
hid  
x

x
and  
x

x
sheltered  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
while,  
x

x
and  
x

x
can  
x

x
see  
x

x
much  
x

x
without  
x

x
being  
x

x
seen.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
much  
x

x
use,  
x

x
if  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
here,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
who  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
looking  
x

x
up  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain’s  
x

x
peak,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
expected  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
perched  
x

x
there  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
bird  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
steeple. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
must  
x

x
take  
x

x
our  
x

x
chance  
x

x
of  
x

x
that,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
can  
x

x
go  
x

x
no  
x

x
further  
x

x
to-day.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hear,  
x

x
hear!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
flung  
x

x
himself  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
rock-chamber  
x

x
there  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
room  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
chamber  
x

x
further  
x

x
in,  
x

x
more  
x

x
removed  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
  
x

x
outside. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
deserted;  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
wild  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
animals  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
used  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
dominion. 
x

x
There  
x

x
they  
x

x
laid  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
burdens;  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
threw  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
down  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
and  
x

x
slept,  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
sat  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
outer  
x

x
  
x

x
door  
x

x
and  
x

x
discussed  
x

x
their  
x

x
plans. 
x

x
In  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
talk  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
perpetually  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
thing:  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
Smaug?  
x

x
They  
x

x
looked  
x

x
West  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
East  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
nothing,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
South  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon,  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
gathering  
x

x
of  
x

x
very  
x

x
many  
x

x
birds. 
x

x
At  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondered;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
  
x

x
understanding  
x

x
it,  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
cold  
x

x
stars  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
out.

Now

to

hear

news

of  
x

Smaug,  
x

x
you

go

back

again

to

the

evening

when

he  
x

x
smashed

the

door  
x

and  
x

x
flew  
x

x
off  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

rage,  
x

x
two  
x

x
days  
x

x
before.

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake-town  
x

x
Esgaroth  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
indoors,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
breeze  
x

x
was  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
black  
x

x
East  
x

x
and  
x

x
chill,  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
were  
x

x
walking  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
quays,  
x

x
and  
x

x
watching,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
fond  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
doing,  
x

x
the  
x

x
stars

shine  
x

out

from

the

smooth

x
  
x

x
patches  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
as  
x

they  
x

x
opened  
x

x
in  
x

x
the

sky. 
x

x
  
x

x
From  
x

x
their  
x

x
town  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
was  
x

x
mostly  
x

x
  
x

x
screened  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
low  
x

x
hills  
x

x
at  
x

a  
x

x
gap  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
its  
x

x
high  
x

x
peak  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
they  
x

x
see  
x

x
in  
x

x
clear  
x

x
weather,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
at  
x

x
it,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
ominous  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drear  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
lost  
x

x
and  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
blotted  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
it  
x

x
flickered  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
view;  
x

x
a  
x

x
brief  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
glow  
x

x
touched  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
faded. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Look!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
one. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
lights  
x

x
again!  
x

x
Last  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
the  
x

x
watchmen  
x

x
saw  
x

x
them  
x

x
start  
x

x
and  
x

x
fade  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
midnight  
x

x
until  
x

x
dawn. 
x

x
Something  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
happening  
x

x
up  
x

x
there.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Perhaps  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
forging  
x

x
gold,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
another. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
long  
x

x
since  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
North. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
time  
x

x
the  
x

x
songs  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
prove  
x

x
  
x

x
themselves  
x

again.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Which  
x

x
king?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
another  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
grim  
x

x
  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
“As  
x

x
like  
x

x
as  
x

x
not  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
marauding  
x

x
fire  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon,  
x

x
the  
x

x
only  
x

x
king  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
ever  
x

x
known.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
always  
x

x
foreboding  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
things!”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
others. 
x

x
“Anything  
x

x
from  
x

x
floods  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
poisoned  
x

x
fish. 
x

x
Think  
x

x
of  
x

x
something  
x

x
cheerful!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
light  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
low  
x

x
place  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
northern  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
lake  
x

x
turned  
x

x
golden. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
King  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
“His  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
is  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Sun,  
x

x
his  
x

x
silver  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
fountain,  
x

x
his  
x

x
rivers  
x

x
golden  
x

x
  
x

x
run!  
x

x
The  
x

x
river  
x

x
is  
x

x
running  
x

x
gold  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
and  
x

x
everywhere  
x

x
windows  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
opening  
x

x
and  
x

x
feet  
x

x
were  
x

x
hurrying. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
a  
x

x
tremendous  
x

x
  
x

x
excitement  
x

x
and  
x

x
enthusiasm. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
grim-  
x

x
  
x

x
voiced  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
ran  
x

x
hotfoot  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
is  
x

x
coming  
x

x
or  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“Cut  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridges!  
x

x
To  
x

x
arms!  
x

x
To  
x

x
arms!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
warning  
x

x
trumpets  
x

x
were  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
  
x

x
sounded,  
x

x
and  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocky  
x

x
shores. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
cheering  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
joy  
x

x
was  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
dread. 
x

x
So  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
quite  
x

x
unprepared. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
long,  
x

x
so  
x

x
great  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
speed,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
him  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
spark  
x

x
of  
x

x
fire  
x

x
rushing  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
growing  
x

x
ever  
x

x
huger  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
bright,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
foolish  
x

x
doubted  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
prophecies  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
rather  
x

x
wrong. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
time. 
x

x
Every  
x

x
vessel  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
water,  
x

x
every  
x

x
warrior  
x

x
was  
x

x
armed,  
x

x
  
x

x
every  
x

x
arrow  
x

x
and  
x

x
dart  
x

x
was  
x

x
ready,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
was  
x

x
thrown  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
destroyed,  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
roar  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug’s  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
approach  
x

x
  
x

x
grew  
x

x
loud,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
rippled  
x

x
red  
x

x
as  
x

x
fire  
x

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
awful  
x

x
beating  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
wings. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Amid  
x

x
shrieks  
x

x
and  
x

x
wailing  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shouts  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
over  
x

x
them,  
x

x
swept  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bridges  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
foiled!  
x

x
The  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
enemies  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
an  
x

x
island  
x

x
in  
x

x
deep  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
—  
x

x
too  
x

x
deep  
x

x
and  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
cool  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
liking. 
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
plunged  
x

x
into  
x

x
it,  
x

x
a  
x

x
vapour  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
steam  
x

x
would  
x

x
arise  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
cover  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
mist  
x

x
for  
x

x
days;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
was  
x

x
mightier  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
he,  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
quench  
x

x
him  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
pass  
x

x
through. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Roaring  
x

x
he  
x

x
swept  
x

x
back  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
town. 
x

x
A  
x

x
hail  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
dark  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
snapped  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
rattled  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
scales  
x

x
and  
x

x
jewels,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
shafts  
x

x
  
x

x
fell  
x

x
back  
x

x
kindled  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
breath  
x

x
burning  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hissing  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
No  
x

x
fireworks  
x

x
you  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
imagined  
x

x
equalled  
x

x
the  
x

x
sights  
x

x
that  
x

x
night. 
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
twanging  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
bows  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
shrilling  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
trumpets  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
blazed  
x

x
to  
x

x
its  
x

x
height,  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
blind  
x

x
and  
x

x
mad  
x

x
with  
x

x
it. 
x

x
No  
x

x
one  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
give  
x

x
battle  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
an  
x

x
age;  
x

x
nor  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
dared  
x

x
now,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
grim-voiced  
x

x
man  
x

x
(Bard  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
name),  
x

x
  
x

x
who  
x

x
ran  
x

x
to  
x

x
and  
x

x
fro  
x

x
cheering  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
archers  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
urging  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
to  
x

x
order  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
fight  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
arrow. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fire  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
jaws. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
circled  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
high  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
above  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
lighting  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake;  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
shores  
x

x
  
x

x
shone  
x

x
like  
x

x
copper  
x

x
and  
x

x
like  
x

x
blood  
x

x
with  
x

x
leaping  
x

x
  
x

x
shadows  
x

x
of  
x

x
dense  
x

x
black  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
he  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
straight  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
arrow-  
x

x
  
x

x
storm,  
x

x
reckless  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
rage,  
x

x
taking  
x

x
no  
x

x
heed  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
turn  
x

x
his  
x

x
scaly  
x

x
sides  
x

x
towards  
x

x
his  
x

x
foes,  
x

x
seeking  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
to  
x

x
set  
x

x
their  
x

x
town  
x

x
ablaze. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Fire  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
from  
x

x
thatched  
x

x
roofs  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
beam-ends  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
hurtled  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
past  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
again,  
x

x
though  
x

x
all  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
drenched  
x

x
with  
x

x
water  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
came. 
x

x
Once  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
water  
x

x
was  
x

x
flung  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
hands  
x

x
  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
a  
x

x
spark  
x

x
appeared. 
x

x
Back  
x

x
swirled  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon. 
x

x
A  
x

x
sweep  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
tail  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
roof  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Great  
x

x
House  
x

x
crumbled  
x

x
and  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
Flames  
x

x
unquenchable  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
high  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
night. 
x

x
Another  
x

x
swoop  
x

x
and  
x

x
another,  
x

x
and  
x

x
another  
x

x
  
x

x
house  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
another  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
afire  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
still  
x

x
no  
x

x
arrow  
x

x
hindered  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
or  
x

x
hurt  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
fly  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
marshes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Already  
x

x
men  
x

x
were  
x

x
jumping  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
every  
x

x
side. 
x

x
Women  
x

x
and  
x

x
children  
x

x
were  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
huddled  
x

x
into  
x

x
laden  
x

x
boats  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
market-pool. 
x

x
  
x

x
Weapons  
x

x
were  
x

x
flung  
x

x
down. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
mourning  
x

x
and  
x

x
weeping,  
x

x
where  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
ago  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs  
x

x
of  
x

x
mirth  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
sung  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
men  
x

x
cursed  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
names. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Master  
x

x
himself  
x

x
was  
x

x
turning  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
gilded  
x

x
boat,  
x

x
hoping  
x

x
to  
x

x
row  
x

x
away  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
confusion  
x

x
and  
x

x
save  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
deserted  
x

x
and  
x

x
burned  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
surface  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
hope. 
x

x
They  
x

x
could  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
get  
x

x
into  
x

x
boats  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
he  
x

x
cared. 
x

x
There  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
fine  
x

x
sport  
x

x
hunting  
x

x
them,  
x

x
or  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
stop  
x

x
  
x

x
till  
x

x
they  
x

x
starved. 
x

x
Let  
x

x
them  
x

x
try  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
to  
x

x
land  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
ready. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
set  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shoreland  
x

x
woods  
x

x
ablaze  
x

x
and  
x

x
wither  
x

x
every  
x

x
field  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
pasture. 
x

x
Just  
x

x
now  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
enjoying  
x

x
the  
x

x
sport  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
town-baiting  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
enjoyed  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
anything  
x

x
for  
x

x
years. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
a  
x

x
company  
x

x
of  
x

x
archers  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
held  
x

x
their  
x

x
ground  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
burning  
x

x
  
x

x
houses. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
captain  
x

x
was  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
grim-voiced  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
grim-faced,  
x

x
whose  
x

x
friends  
x

x
had  
x

x
accused  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
of  
x

x
prophesying  
x

x
floods  
x

x
and  
x

x
poisoned  
x

x
fish,  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
his  
x

x
worth  
x

x
and  
x

x
courage. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
descendant  
x

x
in  
x

x
long  
x

x
line  
x

x
of  
x

x
Girion,  
x

x
Lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
whose  
x

x
wife  
x

x
and  
x

x
child  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruin  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
shot  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
yew  
x

x
bow,  
x

x
till  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
one  
x

x
were  
x

x
spent. 
x

x
The  
x

x
flames  
x

x
were  
x

x
near  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
companions  
x

x
were  
x

x
leaving  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
bent  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
bow  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
time.

x

x
He  
x

x
started  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
only  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
thrush. 
x

x
Unafraid  
x

x
it  
x

x
perched  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
ear  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
him  
x

x
news. 
x

x
Marvelling  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
understand  
x

x
its  
x

x
tongue,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
race  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Wait!  
x

x
Wait!”  
x

x
it  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
moon  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
rising. 
x

x
Look  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
hollow  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
breast  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
flies  
x

x
and  
x

x
turns  
x

x
above  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
And  
x

x
while  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
  
x

x
paused  
x

x
in  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
it  
x

x
told  
x

x
him  
x

x
of  
x

x
tidings  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
drew  
x

x
his  
x

x
bow-string  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
ear. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
was  
x

x
circling  
x

x
back,  
x

x
flying  
x

x
low,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
rose  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
  
x

x
shore  
x

x
and  
x

x
silvered  
x

x
his  
x

x
great  
x

x
wings. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Arrow!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
bowman. 
x

x
“Black  
x

x
arrow!  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
saved  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
last. 
x

x
You  
x

x
have  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
failed  
x

x
me  
x

x
and  
x

x
always  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
recovered  
x

x
you. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
you  
x

x
from  
x

x
my  
x

x
father  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
from  
x

x
of  
x

x
old. 
x

x
If  
x

x
  
x

x
ever  
x

x
you  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
forges  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
true  
x

x
king  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
go  
x

x
nowand  
x

x
speed  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
swooped  
x

x
once  
x

x
more  
x

x
lower  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
dived  
x

x
down  
x

x
his  
x

x
belly  
x

x
  
x

x
glittered  
x

x
white  
x

x
with  
x

x
sparkling  
x

x
fires  
x

x
of  
x

x
gems  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
one  
x

x
place. 
x

x
The  
x

x
great  
x

x
bow  
x

x
  
x

x
twanged. 
x

x
The  
x

x
black  
x

x
arrow  
x

x
sped  
x

x
straight  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
string,  
x

x
straight  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
hollow  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
left  
x

x
  
x

x
breast  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
foreleg  
x

x
was  
x

x
flung  
x

x
wide. 
x

x
In  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
smote  
x

x
and  
x

x
vanished,  
x

x
barb,  
x

x
shaft  
x

x
and  
x

x
feather,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
was  
x

x
its  
x

x
flight. 
x

x
With  
x

x
a  
x

x
shriek  
x

that  
x

x
deafened  
x

x
  
x

x
men,

x
felled

trees  
x

x
and  
x

x
split  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
shot  
x

x
  
x

x
spouting  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
air,  
x

x
turned  
x

x
over  
x

x
and  
x

x
crashed  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
on  
x

x
high  
x

x
in  
x

x
ruin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Full  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell. 
x

x
His  
x

x
last  
x

x
throes  
x

x
  
x

x
splintered  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
sparks  
x

x
and  
x

x
gledes. 
x

x
The  
x

x
lake  
x

x
  
x

x
roared  
x

x
in. 
x

x
A  
x

x
vast  
x

x
steam  
x

x
leaped  
x

x
up,  
x

x
white  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
dark  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
moon. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
hiss,  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
gushing  
x

x
whirl,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
silence. 
x

x
And  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
and  
x

x
Esgaroth,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
waxing  
x

x
moon  
x

x
rose  
x

x
higher  
x

x
and  
x

x
higher  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
grew  
x

x
loud  
x

x
and  
x

x
cold. 
x

x
It  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
the  
x

x
white  
x

x
  
x

x
fog  
x

x
into  
x

x
bending  
x

x
pillars  
x

x
and  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
drove  
x

x
it  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
West  
x

x
to  
x

x
scatter  
x

x
in  
x

x
tattered  
x

x
  
x

x
shreds  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
before  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
many  
x

x
boats  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
dotted  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
surface  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
voices  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
of  
x

x
Esgaroth  
x

x
  
x

x
lamenting  
x

x
their  
x

x
lost  
x

x
town  
x

x
and  
x

x
goods  
x

x
and  
x

x
ruined  
x

x
  
x

x
houses. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
really  
x

x
much  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
thankful  
x

x
  
x

x
for,  
x

x
had  
x

x
they  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
though  
x

x
it  
x

x
could  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
expected  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
should  
x

x
just  
x

x
then:  
x

x
three  
x

x
  
x

x
quarters  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
had  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
alive;  
x

x
their  
x

x
woods  
x

x
and  
x

x
fields  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
pastures  
x

x
and  
x

x
cattle  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
boats  
x

x
  
x

x
remained  
x

x
undamaged;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
dead. 
x

x
What  
x

x
that  
x

x
meant  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
realized. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
in  
x

x
mournful  
x

x
crowds  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
western  
x

x
shores,  
x

x
shivering  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
first  
x

x
complaints  
x

x
and  
x

x
anger  
x

x
were  
x

x
against  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
so  
x

x
soon,  
x

x
while  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
defend  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“He  
x

x
may  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
head  
x

x
for  
x

x
business  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
especially  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
business,”  
x

x
some  
x

x
murmured,  
x

x
  
x

x
“but  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
good  
x

x
when  
x

x
anything  
x

x
serious  
x

x
  
x

x
happens!”  
x

x
And  
x

x
they  
x

x
praised  
x

x
the  
x

x
courage  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
last  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
shot. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
only  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
killed,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
said,  
x

x
“we  
x

x
would  
x

x
make  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
king. 
x

x
Bard  
x

x
the  
x

x
Dragon-shooter  
x

x
of  
x

x
the

line

of

x

x

x
Girion!  
x

x
Alas

that  
x

he  
x

is  
x

x
lost!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
midst  
x

x
of  
x

x
theirtalk  
x

x
a  
x

x
tall  
x

x
figure  
x

x
  
x

x
stepped  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
shadows. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
drenched  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
water,  
x

x
his  
x

x
black  
x

x
hair  
x

x
hung  
x

x
wet  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
face  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
shoulders,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
fierce  
x

x
light  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bard  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
lost!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
dived  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
Esgaroth,  
x

x
when  
x

the

slain.

I

Bard,

of

the

I

x
“King

Bard!  
x

x
King  
x

x
Bard!”  
x

x
they

shouted;

but  
x

x
  
x

x
the

Master

ground  
x

his

chattering

teeth.

“Girion

he

“In

at

“We

the

“I

warily

(for

rich  
x

x
  
x

x
gifts  
x

x
and  
x

x
ample  
x

x
help,  
x

x
and  
x

x
led  
x

x
us  
x

x
to  
x

x
believe  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs  
x

x
could  
x

x
come  
x

x
true?  
x

x
Who  
x

x
played  
x

x
on  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
soft  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
and  
x

x
our  
x

x
pleasant  
x

x
fancies?  
x

x
What  
x

x
sort  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
have  
x

x
they  
x

x
sent  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
reward  
x

x
  
x

x
us?  
x

x
Dragon-fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
ruin!  
x

x
From  
x

x
whom  
x

x
should  
x

x
  
x

x
we  
x

x
claim  
x

x
the  
x

x
recompense  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
damage,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
aid  
x

x
for  
x

x
our  
x

x
widows  
x

x
and  
x

x
orphans?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
you  
x

x
see,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
got  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
position  
x

x
for  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
The  
x

x
result  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
words  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
quite  
x

x
forgot  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
idea  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
king,  
x

x
and  
x

x
turned  
x

x
their  
x

x
angry  
x

x
  
x

x
thoughts  
x

x
towards  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
company. 
x

x
Wild  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
words  
x

x
were  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
from  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
sides;  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
before  
x

x
sung  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
songs  
x

x
loudest,  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
heard  
x

x
as  
x

x
loudly  
x

x
  
x

x
crying  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
stirred  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
against  
x

x
them  
x

x
deliberately!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Fools!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
waste  
x

x
words  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
on  
x

x
those  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
creatures?  
x

x
Doubtless  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
perished  
x

x
first  
x

x
in  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
before  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
us.”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
even  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
speaking,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
came  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fabled  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
lying  
x

x
without  
x

x
guard  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
owner,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
silent. 
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master’s  
x

x
words,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
rebuilt,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
golden  
x

x
bells,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
but  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
men. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
length  
x

x
he  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
again:  
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
angry  
x

x
words,  
x

x
Master,  
x

x
or  
x

x
for  
x

x
considering  
x

x
  
x

x
weighty  
x

x
plans  
x

x
of  
x

x
change. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
work  
x

x
to  
x

x
do. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
serve  
x

x
you  
x

x
still  
x

x
—  
x

x
though  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
think  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
words  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
North  
x

x
with  
x

x
any  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
follow  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
strode  
x

x
off  
x

x
to  
x

x
help  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
ordering  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
camps  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
care  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wounded. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
scowled  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
went,  
x

x
and  
x

x
remained  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
thought  
x

x
much  
x

x
but  
x

x
said  
x

x
little,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
call  
x

x
loudly  
x

x
for  
x

x
men  
x

x
to  
x

x
bring  
x

x
him  
x

x
fire  
x

x
and  
x

x
food. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
everywhere  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
went  
x

x
he  
x

x
found  
x

x
talk  
x

x
  
x

x
running  
x

x
like  
x

x
fire  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
concerning  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
vast  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
unguarded. 
x

x
Men  
x

x
  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
recompense  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
their  
x

x
harm  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
soon  
x

x
get  
x

x
from  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
spare  
x

x
with  
x

x
which  
x

x
to  
x

x
buy  
x

x
rich  
x

x
things  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
South;  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
cheered  
x

x
them  
x

x
greatly  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
plight. 
x

x
That  
x

x
was  
x

x
as  
x

x
well,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
night  
x

x
was  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
miserable. 
x

x
Shelters  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
contrived  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
few  
x

x
(the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
had  
x

x
one)  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
food  
x

x
(even  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
went  
x

x
short). 
x

x
Many  
x

x
took  
x

x
ill  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
wet  
x

x
and  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
sorrow  
x

x
that  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
died,  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
uninjured  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruin  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town;  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
sickness  
x

x
and  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
hunger. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Meanwhile  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
took  
x

x
the  
x

x
lead,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ordered  
x

x
  
x

x
things  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished,  
x

x
though  
x

x
always  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Master’s  
x

x
name,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
hard  
x

x
task  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
govern  
x

x
the  
x

x
people  
x

x
and  
x

x
direct  
x

x
the  
x

x
preparations  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
protection  
x

x
and  
x

x
housing. 
x

x
Probably  
x

x
most  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
perished  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
winter  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
after  
x

x
autumn,  
x

x
if  
x

x
help  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
hand. 
x

x
But  
x

x
help  
x

x
came  
x

x
swiftly;  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
speedy  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
sent  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
the  
x

x
aid  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood,  
x

x
and  
x

x
these  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
had  
x

x
found  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
host  
x

x
already  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
move,  
x

x
although  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
third  
x

x
day  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
fall  
x

x
of  
x

x
Smaug. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
had  
x

x
received  
x

x
news  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
birds  
x

x
that  
x

x
loved  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
and  
x

x
already  
x

x
knew  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
happened. 
x

x
Very  
x

x
great  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
commotion  
x

x
among  
x

x
all  
x

x
things  
x

x
with  
x

x
wings  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
dwelt  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Desolation  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Dragon. 
x

x
The  
x

x
air  
x

x
was  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
circling  
x

x
flocks,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
swift-flying  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
flew  
x

x
here  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky. 
x

x
Above  
x

x
the  
x

x
borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
whistling,  
x

x
crying  
x

x
and  
x

x
piping. 
x

x
  
x

x
Far  
x

x
over  
x

x
Mirkwood  
x

x
tidings  
x

x
spread:  
x

x
“Smaug  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
dead!”  
x

x
Leaves  
x

x
rustled  
x

x
and  
x

x
startled  
x

x
ears  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
lifted. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
rode  
x

x
forth  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
news  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
west  
x

x
right  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
pinewoods  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains;  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
had  
x

x
heard  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
wooden  
x

x
house,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
council  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
caves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
hear  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
Oakenshield,  
x

x
I  
x

x
fear,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
king. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
better  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
remained  
x

x
my  
x

x
guest. 
x

x
It  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
an  
x

x
ill  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
same,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
added,  
x

x
“that  
x

x
  
x

x
blows  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
any  
x

x
good.”  
x

x
For  
x

x
he  
x

x
too  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
the  
x

x
legend  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thror. 
x

x
So  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
that  
x

x
Bard’s  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
found  
x

x
him  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
marching  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
spearmen  
x

x
and  
x

x
bowmen;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
crows  
x

x
were  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
thick  
x

x
above  
x

x
him,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
thought  
x

x
that  
x

x
war  
x

x
was  
x

x
awakening  
x

x
again,  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
been  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
parts  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
age. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
king,  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
received  
x

x
the  
x

x
prayers  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
had  
x

x
pity,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
lord  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
kindly  
x

x
people;  
x

x
so  
x

x
turning  
x

x
his  
x

x
march,  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
at  
x

x
first  
x

x
been  
x

x
direct  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
hastened  
x

x
now  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Long  
x

x
  
x

x
Lake. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
boats  
x

x
or  
x

x
rafts  
x

x
enough  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
host,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
forced  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
the  
x

x
slower  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
foot;  
x

x
but  
x

x
great  
x

x
store  
x

x
of  
x

x
goods  
x

x
he  
x

x
sent  
x

x
ahead  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
water. 
x

x
Still  
x

x
elves  
x

x
are  
x

x
light-footed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
these  
x

x
days  
x

x
much  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
marches  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
treacherous  
x

x
lands  
x

x
between  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
their  
x

x
going  
x

x
was  
x

x
swift. 
x

x
  
x

x
Only  
x

x
five  
x

x
days  
x

x
after  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
shores  
x

x
and  
x

x
looked  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruins  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
town. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
welcome  
x

x
was  
x

x
good,  
x

x
as  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
expected,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
Master  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
any  
x

x
bargain  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
future  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
return  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking’s  
x

x
aid. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
plans  
x

x
were  
x

x
soon  
x

x
made. 
x

x
With  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
women  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
children,  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
unfit,  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
remained  
x

x
behind;  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
some  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
crafts  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
skilled  
x

x
elves;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
busied  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
felling  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
collecting  
x

x
the  
x

x
timber  
x

x
sent  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest. 
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
set  
x

x
about  
x

x
raising  
x

x
many  
x

x
huts  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
oncoming  
x

x
winter;  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master’s  
x

x
direction  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
planning  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
town,  
x

x
designed  
x

x
more  
x

x
fair  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
large  
x

x
even  
x

x
than  
x

x
before,  
x

x
but  
x

x
not  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
  
x

x
place. 
x

x
They  
x

x
removed  
x

x
northward  
x

x
higher  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shore;  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever  
x

x
after  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
dread  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
water  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
lay. 
x

x
He  
x

x
would  
x

x
never  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
return  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
golden  
x

x
bed,  
x

x
but  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
stretched  
x

x
cold  
x

x
as  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
floor  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
shallows. 
x

x
There  
x

x
for  
x

x
ages  
x

x
his  
x

x
huge  
x

x
bones  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
in  
x

x
calm  
x

x
weather  
x

x
amid  
x

x
the  
x

x
ruined  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
piles  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
town. 
x

x
But  
x

x
few  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cursed  
x

x
spot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
none  
x

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
dive  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
shivering  
x

x
water  
x

x
or  
x

x
recover  
x

x
the  
x

x
precious  
x

x
stones  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
fell  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
rotting  
x

x
carcase. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
arms  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
able,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking’s  
x

x
array,  
x

x
got  
x

x
ready  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
march  
x

x
north  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

Mountain. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
thus  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
eleven  
x

x
days  
x

x
from  
x

x
the

the

end  
x

of

the

and

came

into

the

desolate

THE

GATHERING

OF

THE

CLOUDS

Now

we

will

x
return  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
All  
x

x
  
x

x
night  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
watched,  
x

x
but  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
came  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
heard  
x

x
or  
x

x
seen  
x

x
any  
x

x
  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
danger. 
x

x
But  
x

x
ever  
x

x
more  
x

x
thickly  
x

x
the  
x

x
birds  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
gathering. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
companies  
x

x
came  
x

x
flying  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
South;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
crows  
x

x
that  
x

x
still  
x

x
lived  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
were  
x

x
wheeling  
x

x
and  
x

x
crying  
x

x
  
x

x
unceasingly  
x

x
above. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Something  
x

x
strange  
x

x
is  
x

x
happening,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
time  
x

x
has  
x

x
gone  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
  
x

x
wanderings;  
x

x
and  
x

x
these  
x

x
are  
x

x
birds  
x

x
that  
x

x
dwell  
x

x
  
x

x
always  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
land;  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
starlings  
x

x
and  
x

x
flocks  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
finches;  
x

x
and  
x

x
far  
x

x
off  
x

x
there  
x

x
are  
x

x
many  
x

x
carrion  
x

x
  
x

x
birds  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
a  
x

x
battle  
x

x
were  
x

x
afoot!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
pointed:  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
that  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
thrush  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
“He  
x

x
seems  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
escaped,  
x

x
when  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
smashed  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-  
x

x
  
x

x
side,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
the  
x

x
snails  
x

x
have!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Sure  
x

x
enough  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
thrush  
x

x
was  
x

x
there,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
pointed,  
x

x
he  
x

x
flew  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
perched  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone  
x

x
near  
x

x
by. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
fluttered  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
wings  
x

x
and  
x

x
sang;  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
cocked  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
side,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
to  
x

x
listen;  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
he  
x

x
sang,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
again  
x

x
he  
x

x
listened. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
believe  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
tell  
x

x
us  
x

x
something,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin;  
x

x
‘‘but  
x

x
I  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
follow  
x

x
the  
x

x
speech  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
very  
x

x
quick  
x

x
and  
x

x
difficult. 
x

x
Can  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
it  
x

x
out  
x

x
Baggins?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
very  
x

x
well,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
(as  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
fact,  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
make  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
at  
x

x
all);  
x

x
“but  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
old  
x

x
fellow  
x

x
seems  
x

x
very  
x

x
excited.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
only  
x

x
wish  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
raven!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
thought  
x

x
you  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
like  
x

x
them!  
x

x
You  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
very  
x

x
shy  
x

x
of  
x

x
them,  
x

x
when  
x

x
we  
x

x
came  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
way  
x

x
before.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Those  
x

x
were  
x

x
crows!  
x

x
And  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
suspicious-  
x

x
  
x

x
looking  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
at  
x

x
that,  
x

x
and  
x

x
rude  
x

x
as

well. 
x

x
You  
x

x
  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
ugly  
x

x
names  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
calling  
x

x
after  
x

x
us. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
ravens  
x

x
are  
x

x
different. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
great  
x

x
friendship

between

them  
x

and  
x

x
the  
x

people

of  
x

x
Thror;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
often  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
us  
x

x
secret  
x

x
news,  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
rewarded  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
such  
x

x
bright  
x

x
things  
x

x
as  
x

they  
x

coveted  
x

x
to  
x

x
hide  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
dwellings. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
live  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
year,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
memories  
x

x

are

long,

they

on

their

wisdom

to  
x

x
their

children. 
x

x
I  
x

knew  
x

x
many  
x

x
among  
x

x
the

ravens

of

x
the

x

x
rocks

x
when  
x

I  
x

was  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf-lad. 
x

x
This  
x

x
very  
x

x
height  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
once  
x

x
named  
x

x
Ravenhill,  
x

x
because  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
wise  
x

x
and  
x

x
famous  
x

x
pair,  
x

x
old  
x

x
Care  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
wife,  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
lived  
x

x
here  
x

above

the  
x

x
guard-chamber. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
that  
x

x
any  
x

x
of

that  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
breed  
x

x

linger

here

now.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
No  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
had  
x

x
he  
x

x
finished  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
thrush  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
call,  
x

x
and  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
  
x

x
flew  
x

x
away. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
may  
x

x
not  
x

x
understand  
x

x
him,  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
bird  
x

x
understands  
x

x
us,  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Keep  
x

x
watch  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
what  
x

x
happens!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
fluttering  
x

x
of  
x

x
wings,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
back  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
thrush;  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
decrepit  
x

x
old  
x

x
bird. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
blind,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
fly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
bald. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
an  
x

x
aged  
x

x
raven  
x

x
of  
x

x
great  
x

x
size. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
alighted  
x

x
stiffly  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ground  
x

x
before  
x

x
them,  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
flapped  
x

x
his  
x

x
wings,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bobbed  
x

x
towards  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
son

of

Thrain,

Balin

son

of

Fundin,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
croaked  
x

x
(and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
understand  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
used  
x

x
ordinary

language

not

“Dead!

“Yes,

It

time

At

length

he

told

rather

him

that

shot

the

Girion;

he

is

it

Then

Thorin

burst

forth

in

anger:

Also

North,

west

from

here

them

plight. 
x

x
But

go  
x

specially

to  
x

x
my

x
cousin

x

x
Dain  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Iron

Hills,

for

he

has

x
many

people

well-armed,

dwells

nearest

to

this

place.

him

“I

bad,”  
x

croaked  
x

x
Roac,  
x

x
“but  
x

I

will

do

what

be

x

x
done.”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
off  
x

x
he  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
flew. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Back  
x

x
now

x
to  
x

x
the

Mountain!”  
x

cried  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
“We

little

time

to

lose.”

x

x
“And

little

food

to

use!”  
x

cried  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
always  
x

x
  
x

x
practical  
x

x
on  
x

x
such  
x

x
points. 
x

x
In  
x

x
any  
x

x
case  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
was,  
x

x
properly  
x

x
speaking,  
x

x
over  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
—  
x

x
in  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
mistaken  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
given  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
profits  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
peaceful  
x

x
winding  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
affairs. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
heard  
x

x
him;  
x

x
so  
x

x
back  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
with  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
events  
x

x
already,  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
see  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
still  
x

x
had  
x

x
some  
x

x
  
x

x
days  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
They  
x

x
explored  
x

x
the  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
  
x

x
once  
x

x
more,  
x

x
and  
x

x
found,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
expected,  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
only  
x

x
the  
x

x
Front  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
remained  
x

x
open;  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
gates  
x

x
(except,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
the  
x

x
small  
x

x
secret  
x

x
door)  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
ago  
x

x
been  
x

x
broken  
x

x
and  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
remained. 
x

x
So  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
labour  
x

x
hard  
x

x
in  
x

x
fortifying  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
  
x

x
entrance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
path  
x

x
that  
x

x
led  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Tools  
x

x
were  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
found  
x

x
in  
x

x
plenty  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
miners  
x

x
and  
x

x
quarriers  
x

x
and  
x

x
builders  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
used;  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
such  
x

x
work  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
skilled. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
worked  
x

x
the  
x

x
ravens  
x

x
brought  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
constant  
x

x
tidings. 
x

x
In  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
learned  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
had  
x

x
turned  
x

x
aside  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
still  
x

x
had  
x

x
a  
x

x
breathing  
x

x
space. 
x

x
Better  
x

x
still,  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
heard  
x

x
that  
x

x
three  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
had  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
wandering  
x

x
wild  
x

x
far  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
banks  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River,  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
stores  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
left. 
x

x
So  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
work,  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
were  
x

x
sent,  
x

x
  
x

x
guided  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
raven,  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
and  
x

x
bring  
x

x
  
x

x
back  
x

x
all  
x

x
they  
x

x
could. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
were  
x

x
four  
x

x
days  
x

x
gone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
knew  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
joined  
x

x
armies  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
toward  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
But  
x

x
now  
x

x
their  
x

x
hopes  
x

x
were  
x

x
higher;  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
food  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
weeks  
x

x
with  
x

x
care  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
chiefly  
x

x
cram,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
very  
x

x
tired  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
it;  
x

x
but  
x

x
cram  
x

x
is  
x

x
much  
x

x
better  
x

x
than  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
already  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
was  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
wall  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
squared  
x

x
stones  
x

x
laid  
x

x
dry,  
x

x
but  
x

x
very  
x

x
thick  
x

x
and  
x

x
high,  
x

x
  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
opening. 
x

x
There  
x

x
were  
x

x
holes  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wall  
x

x
through  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
(or  
x

x
shoot),  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
entrance. 
x

x
They  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
in  
x

x
or  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
ladders,  
x

x
and  
x

x
hauled  
x

x
stuff  
x

x
up  
x

x
with  
x

x
ropes. 
x

x
For  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
issuing  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
contrived  
x

x
a  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
low  
x

x
arch  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
new  
x

x
wall;  
x

x
but  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
entrance  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
so  
x

x
altered  
x

x
the  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
bed  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
pool  
x

x
stretched  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountain-  
x

x
  
x

x
wall  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fall  
x

x
over  
x

x
which  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
towards  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
Approach  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
only  
x

x
possible,  
x

x
without  
x

x
swimming,  
x

x
along  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
ledge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
cliff,  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
right  
x

x
as  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
looked  
x

x
outwards  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
The  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
only  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
head  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
steps  
x

x
above  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
bridge,  
x

x
and  
x

x
unloading  
x

x
them  
x

x
there  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
bidden  
x

x
them  
x

x
return  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
masters  
x

x
and  
x

x
sent  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
back  
x

x
riderless  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
South. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
night  
x

x
when  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
lights  
x

x
as  
x

x
of  
x

x
fires  
x

x
and  
x

x
torches  
x

x
away  
x

x
south  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
have  
x

x
come!”  
x

x
called  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
camp  
x

x
is  
x

x
very  
x

x
great. 
x

x
They  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
cover  
x

x
of  
x

x
dusk  
x

x
along  
x

x
both  
x

x
  
x

x
banks  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
night  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
slept  
x

x
little. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
morning  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
pale  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
company  
x

x
approaching. 
x

x
From  
x

x
behind  
x

x
their  
x

x
wall  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
watched  
x

x
them  
x

x
come  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
climb  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
up. 
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
both  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lake  
x

x
armed  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
for  
x

x
war  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
bowmen  
x

x
were  
x

x
among  
x

x
them. 
x

x
At  
x

x
length  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
foremost  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
the  
x

x
tumbled  
x

x
  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
and  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
falls;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
very  
x

x
great  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
surprise  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
pool  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
blocked  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
wall  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
new-hewn  
x

x
stone. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
stood  
x

x
pointing  
x

x
and  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
to  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
another  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
them:  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
called  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
loud  
x

x
voice,  
x

x
“that  
x

x
come  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
war  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
gates  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain,  
x

x
King  
x

x
  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
what  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
desire?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
answered  
x

x
nothing. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
turned  
x

x
  
x

x
swiftly  
x

x
back,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
others  
x

x
after  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
while  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
its  
x

x
defences  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
followed  
x

x
them. 
x

x
That  
x

x
day  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp  
x

x
was  
x

x
moved  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
east  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
right  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
The  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
then  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
voices  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
song,  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
done  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
day. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
of  
x

x
elven-  
x

x
  
x

x
harps  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
sweet  
x

x
music;  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them  
x

x
it  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
chill  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
warmed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
caught  
x

x
faintly  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
fragrance  
x

x
of  
x

x
woodland  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
blossoming  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
spring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
longed  
x

x
to  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
  
x

x
fortress  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
join  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mirth  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
feasting  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
fires. 
x

x
Some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
younger  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
moved  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hearts,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
muttered  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
wished  
x

x
things  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
otherwise  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
might  
x

x
welcome  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
folk  
x

x
as  
x

x
friends;  
x

x
but  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
scowled. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
brought  
x

x
forth  
x

x
  
x

x
harps  
x

x
and  
x

x
instruments  
x

x
regained  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hoard,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
made  
x

x
music  
x

x
to  
x

x
soften  
x

x
his  
x

x
mood;  
x

x
but  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
song  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
as  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
song,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
song  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
sung  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
in  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit-hole. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

The

King

has

come

unto

his  
x

x
hall!  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
foe  
x

x
is  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Worm  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dread,

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
ever

x
so  
x

his

foes

x
shall

fall. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

x
sword  
x

x
is  
x

x
sharp,  
x

x
the  
x

x
spear  
x

x
is

x
long,  
x

x
  
x

x
The

arrow

swift,

the

Gate

is

strong;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

heart  
x

x
is  
x

x
bold

that

looks

on

gold;

The

x

x
The

dwarves

of

yore

x
made

mighty  
x

x
spells,  
x

x
  
x

x
While

hammers

fell

like

x
ringing

bells  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x

In

places

deep,

where

dark

things

sleep,

In

On

silver

The

of

on

they

hung  
x

x

x
The

dragon-fire,  
x

x
from  
x

x
twisted  
x

x
wire  
x

x
  
x

x
The

melody

of

wrung.

The

O!

wandering

folk,  
x

the

summons

heed!

Come

haste!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
haste!  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
waste!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

king  
x

x
of  
x

x
friend

and  
x

x
kin  
x

x
has

x
need. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
cal  
x

x
I  
x

x
we  
x

x
over  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
  
x

x
‘Come

x
back  
x

x
unto  
x

x
the  
x

x
caverns  
x

x
old’!  
x

x
  
x

x
Here  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gates  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
awaits,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
hands  
x

x
are  
x

x
rich

x
with  
x

gems  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

king  
x

x
is  
x

x
come  
x

x
unto  
x

x
his  
x

x
hall  
x

x
  
x

x
Under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
tall. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Worm  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dread  
x

x
is  
x

x
slain  
x

x
and  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
ever  
x

x
so  
x

x
our  
x

x
foes  
x

x
shall  
x

x
fall!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
song  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
to  
x

x
please  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
smiled  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
grew  
x

x
merry;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
began  
x

x
  
x

x
reckoning  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Iron  
x

x
Hills  
x

x
and  
x

x
how  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
before  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
could  
x

x
reach  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
set  
x

x
out  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
message  
x

x
reached  
x

x
him. 
x

x
But  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
heart  
x

x
  
x

x
fell,  
x

x
both  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
song  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
talk:  
x

x
they  
x

x
sounded  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
too  
x

x
warlike. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
morning  
x

x
early  
x

x
a  
x

x
company  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
spearmen  
x

x
was  
x

x
seen  
x

x
crossing  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
marching  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
They  
x

x
bore  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
green  
x

x
banner  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
blue  
x

x
  
x

x
banner  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
advanced  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
stood  
x

x
right  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Again  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
voice:  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
that  
x

x
come  
x

x
armed  
x

x
for  
x

x
war  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
gates  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain,  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain?”  
x

x
This  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
answered. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
A  
x

x
tall  
x

x
man  
x

x
stood  
x

x
forward,  
x

x
dark  
x

x
of  
x

x
hair  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
grim  
x

x
of  
x

x
face,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried:  
x

x
“Hail  
x

x
Thorin!  
x

x
Why  
x

x
do  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
fence  
x

x
yourself  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
robber  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
hold?  
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
foes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
rejoice  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
alive  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
our  
x

x
hope. 
x

x
We  
x

x
came  
x

x
expecting  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
find  
x

x
none  
x

x
living  
x

x
here;  
x

x
yet  
x

x
now  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
met  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
matter  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
parley  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
council.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you,  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
parley?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
hand  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
  
x

x
slain  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
delivered. 
x

x
Is  
x

x
that  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
matter  
x

x
that  
x

x
concerns  
x

x
you?  
x

x
Moreover  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
right  
x

x
descent  
x

x
the  
x

x
heir  
x

x
of  
x

x
Girion  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
is  
x

x
mingled  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
halls  
x

x
and  
x

x
towns,  
x

x
which  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
stole. 
x

x
Is  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
we  
x

x
may  
x

x
speak?  
x

x
  
x

x
Further  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
last  
x

x
battle  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
destroyed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwellings  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
Esgaroth,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
servant  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
Master. 
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
speak  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
and  
x

x
ask  
x

x
whether  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
thought  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
sorrow  
x

x
and  
x

x
misery  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
people. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
aided  
x

x
you  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
distress,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
recompense  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
thus  
x

x
far  
x

x
brought  
x

x
ruin  
x

x
only,  
x

x
though  
x

x
  
x

x
doubtless  
x

x
undesigned.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
these  
x

x
were  
x

x
fair  
x

x
words  
x

x
and  
x

x
true,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
proudly  
x

x
and  
x

x
grimly  
x

x
spoken;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
thought  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
would  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
admit  
x

x
what  
x

x
justice  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
them. 
x

x
He  
x

x
did  
x

x
not,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
expect  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
one  
x

x
would  
x

x
remember  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
he  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
discovered  
x

x
all  
x

x
by  
x

x
himself  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon’s  
x

x
weak  
x

x
  
x

x
spot;  
x

x
and  
x

x
that  
x

x
was  
x

x
just  
x

x
as  
x

x
well,  
x

x
for  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
did. 
x

x
But  
x

x
also  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
reckon  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
power  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
gold  
x

x
has  
x

x
upon  
x

x
which  
x

x
a  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
has  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
brooded,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
with  
x

x
dwarvish  
x

x
hearts. 
x

x
Long  
x

x
hours  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
past  
x

x
days  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
spent  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
treasury,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
lust  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
on  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
Though  
x

x
he

hunted  
x

x
chiefly  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Arkenstone,  
x

x
yet  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
an

eye  
x

x
for

x
many  
x

x
another  
x

x
  
x

x
wonderful

thing  
x

x
that

was

lying

there,  
x

x
about

x
which  
x

x

x
were

wound  
x

x
old

memories

of

the

the

sorrows

of

his

race.

x

“You

x

x
Thorin  
x

x
answered. 
x

x
“To

the

treasure

my

no

because

Smaug

it

from

him

x

x
The

treasure  
x

was  
x

x
not

x
that

his

evil

deeds

should

be

with

a

it. 
x

x
The

price  
x

x
of

the

x
and

the

assistance

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
received  
x

x
of

the

Lake-men

But

nothing

we

not

even

x

x
While  
x

x
  
x

x
an

armed  
x

x
host  
x

x
lies  
x

x
before

our

doors,

we

look

on

you

thieves. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It

is  
x

x
in

my

mind

to

of

their

inheritance  
x

x
you

you

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

“A

just

question,”

replied

Bard.

“But

you

we

robbers. 
x

x
Moreover  
x

x
the

may

the

And

still

my

other

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

parley,

I

In

this

again,

first

down

x

x

x
  
x

“The

him,”

Bard.

“We

Then

he

Ere

the

forth

one

cried,

At

the

he

Girion.

From

that

Bard

himself

the

of

Esgaroth;

if

Thorin

the

friendship

of

the

lands

about,

as

his

sires

had

of

old,

then

he

also

somewhat

of

his

own

for

the

Lake.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
seized  
x

x
a  
x

x
bow  
x

x
of  
x

x
horn  
x

x
and  
x

x
shot  
x

x
  
x

x
an

x
arrow  
x

x
at  
x

x
the

x
speaker. 
x

x
It  
x

x
smote  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
shield  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
stuck  
x

there  
x

x
quivering.

x

x

x
“Since

such

is

your

answer,”  
x

he

called

x
in

x
  
x

x
return,  
x

x
“I

the

besieged. 
x

x
You

it,

a

truce

a

parley. 
x

x
We

will

no

weapons

against

x
you,

but  
x

we

leave  
x

you

to

your

gold. 
x

x
You

may

that,

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
messengers  
x

departed  
x

x
swiftly,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the

dwarves

left

to  
x

x
consider  
x

x
their

x

case. 
x

x
So  
x

x
grim  
x

x
had  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
become,

x
that  
x

even

if

they

had

wished,

the

others

would

not

have

x
dared  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
fault  
x

x
with  
x

x
him;  
x

x
but  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
them  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
share  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
old  
x

x
fat  
x

x
Bomburand

x
Fili

Kili. 
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

course,  
x

x
disapproved

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
turn  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
affairs. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
by  
x

x
now  
x

x
had  
x

x
more

enough

of

the

Mountain,

being

besieged

inside

it

was

not

his

x
  
x

x
“The

still

stinks

of

x

x
he

grumbled

to  
x

himself,

“and

x
A  
x

x
THIEF  
x

x
IN  
x

x
THE  
x

x
NIGHT  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
passed  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
and  
x

x
wearily. 
x

x
Many  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
spent  
x

x
their  
x

x
time  
x

x
piling  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
ordering  
x

x
the  
x

x
treasure;  
x

x
and  
x

x
now  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bade  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
eagerly  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
every  
x

x
corner. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“For  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
father,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
“is  
x

x
worth  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
in  
x

x
itself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
me  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
beyond  
x

x
price. 
x

x
That  
x

x
stone  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
I  
x

x
name  
x

x
unto  
x

x
myself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
avenged  
x

x
on  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
who  
x

x
finds  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
withholds  
x

x
  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
heard  
x

x
these  
x

x
words  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
grew  
x

x
  
x

x
afraid,  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
happen,  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stone  
x

x
was  
x

x
found  
x

x
—  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
bundle  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
tattered  
x

x
oddments  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
used  
x

x
as  
x

x
a  
x

x
pillow. 
x

x
All  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
speak  
x

x
of  
x

x
it,  
x

x
for  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
weariness  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
days  
x

x
grew  
x

x
heavier,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
beginnings  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
plan  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
head. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Things  
x

x
had  
x

x
gone  
x

x
on  
x

x
like  
x

x
this  
x

x
for  
x

x
some  
x

x
time,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
the  
x

x
ravens  
x

x
brought  
x

x
news  
x

x
that  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
five  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Iron  
x

x
Hills,  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
within  
x

x
about  
x

x
two  
x

x
days’  
x

x
  
x

x
march  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dale,  
x

x
coming  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North-East. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
they  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
reach  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
unmarked,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Roac,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
I  
x

x
fear  
x

x
lest  
x

x
there  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
battle  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
I  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
call  
x

x
this  
x

x
counsel  
x

x
  
x

x
good. 
x

x
Though  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
a  
x

x
grim  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
overcome  
x

x
the  
x

x
host  
x

x
that  
x

x
besets  
x

x
you;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
did  
x

x
so,  
x

x
what  
x

x
will  
x

x
you  
x

x
gain?  
x

x
Winter  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
snow  
x

x
is  
x

x
hastening  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them. 
x

x
How  
x

x
shall  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
be  
x

x
fed  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
and  
x

x
goodwill  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
about  
x

x
you?  
x

x
The  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
is  
x

x
likely  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
your  
x

x
death,  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
is  
x

x
no  
x

x
more!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
moved. 
x

x
“Winter  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
snow  
x

x
will  
x

x
bite  
x

x
both  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
elves,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
they  
x

x
may  
x

x
find  
x

x
their  
x

x
dwelling  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
waste  
x

x
  
x

x
grievous  
x

x
to  
x

x
bear. 
x

x
With  
x

x
my  
x

x
friends  
x

x
behind  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
winter  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them,  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
softer  
x

x
mood  
x

x
to  
x

x
parley  
x

x
with.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
night  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
made  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
The  
x

x
sky  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
black  
x

x
and  
x

x
moonless. 
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
full  
x

x
  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
corner  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
inner  
x

x
chamber  
x

x
  
x

x
just  
x

x
within  
x

x
the  
x

x
gate  
x

x
and  
x

x
drew  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
bundle  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rope,  
x

x
and  
x

x
also  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
rag. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
Only  
x

x
  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
was  
x

x
there,  
x

x
for  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
his  
x

x
turn  
x

x
to  
x

x
watch,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
kept  
x

x
only  
x

x
one  
x

x
watchman  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
cold!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bombur. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire  
x

x
up  
x

x
here  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
have  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
camp!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
warm  
x

x
enough  
x

x
inside,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
daresay;  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
bound  
x

x
here  
x

x
till  
x

x
  
x

x
midnight,”  
x

x
grumbled  
x

x
the  
x

x
fat  
x

x
dwarf. 
x

x
“A  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
  
x

x
business  
x

x
altogether. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
venture  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
disagree  
x

x
with  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
may  
x

x
his  
x

x
beard  
x

x
grow  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
longer;  
x

x
yet  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
ever  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
  
x

x
neck.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
as  
x

x
stiff  
x

x
as  
x

x
my  
x

x
legs,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
tired  
x

x
of  
x

x
stairs  
x

x
and  
x

x
stone  
x

x
passages. 
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
give  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
good

deal

for

the

x

x

“I

those,

the

But

it

is

long

since

I

I

“You

I

“Off

Bilbo.

As

Bilbo

his  
x

x
rope,  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
down  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
gone. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
about  
x

x
five  
x

x
hours  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
would  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
(he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
at  
x

x
any  
x

x
time,  
x

x
and  
x

x
ever  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
always  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
recapture  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
beautiful  
x

x
dreams  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
then);  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
busy  
x

x
with  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
unlikely  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
any,  
x

x
even  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
or  
x

x
Kili,  
x

x
would  
x

x
come  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
turn. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
after  
x

x
a  
x

x
while,  
x

x
  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
newly  
x

x
made  
x

x
path  
x

x
and  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
course  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream,  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
strange  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
he  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
bend  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
cross  
x

x
the  
x

x
water,  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
make  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
wished. 
x

x
The  
x

x
bed  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
stream  
x

x
was  
x

x
there  
x

x
shallow  
x

x
but  
x

x
already  
x

x
broad,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
fording  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
easy  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
little  
x

x
hobbit. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
across  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
missed  
x

x
his  
x

x
footing  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
round  
x

x
stone  
x

x
and  
x

x
fell  
x

x
into  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
cold  
x

x
water  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
splash. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
barely  
x

x
  
x

x
scrambled  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
far  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
shivering  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
spluttering,  
x

x
when  
x

x
up  
x

x
came  
x

x
elves  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
bright  
x

x
lanterns  
x

x
and  
x

x
searched  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
cause  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
noise. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
fish!”  
x

x
one  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
spy  
x

x
  
x

x
about. 
x

x
Hide  
x

x
your  
x

x
lights!  
x

x
They  
x

x
will  
x

x
help  
x

x
him  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
us,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
that  
x

x
queer  
x

x
little  
x

x
creature  
x

x
that  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
their  
x

x
servant.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Servant,  
x

x
indeed!”  
x

x
snorted  
x

x
Bilbo;  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
snort  
x

x
he  
x

x
sneezed  
x

x
loudly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Let’s  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
light!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
here,  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
slipped  
x

x
off  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
popped  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
a  
x

x
rock. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
seized  
x

x
him  
x

x
quickly,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
surprise. 
x

x
“Who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you?  
x

x
Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves’  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit?  
x

x
What  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
doing?  
x

x
How  
x

x
did  
x

x
you  
x

x
get  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
far  
x

x
past  
x

x
our  
x

x
sentinels?”  
x

x
they  
x

x
asked  
x

x
one  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
another. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
answered,  
x

x
  
x

x
“companion  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
want  
x

x
to  
x

x
know. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
know  
x

x
your  
x

x
king  
x

x
well  
x

x
by  
x

x
sight,  
x

x
though  
x

x
perhaps  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
doesn’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
me  
x

x
to  
x

x
look  
x

x
at. 
x

x
But  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
me,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
I  
x

x
particularly  
x

x
want  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
see.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Indeed!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
they,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
what  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
business?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Whatever  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,  
x

x
it’s  
x

x
my

x
own,  
x

x
my  
x

x
good  
x

x
elves. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
if  
x

x
you

wish  
x

x
ever  
x

x
to  
x

x
get  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
your

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
woods  
x

x
from  
x

x
this  
x

x
cold  
x

x
cheerless  
x

x
place,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
answered  
x

x
shivering,  
x

x
“you  
x

x
will  
x

x
take  
x

x
me  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
quick  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
where  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
dry  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
let  
x

x
me  
x

x
speak  
x

x
to  
x

x
your  
x

x
chiefs  
x

x
as  
x

x
quick  
x

x
as  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
be. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
only  
x

x
an  
x

x
hour  
x

x
or  
x

x
two  
x

x
to  
x

x
spare.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
is  
x

x
how  
x

x
it  
x

x
came  
x

x
about  
x

x
that  
x

x
some  
x

x
two  
x

x
hours  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
his  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
beside  
x

x
a  
x

x
warm  
x

x
fire  
x

x
in  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
tent,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
sat  
x

x
too,  
x

x
gazing  
x

x
curiously  
x

x
at  
x

x
him,  
x

x
both  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
A  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
in  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
  
x

x
armour,  
x

x
partly  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
blanket,  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
something  
x

x
new  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Really  
x

x
you  
x

x
know,”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
saying  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
best  
x

x
business  
x

x
manner,  
x

x
“things  
x

x
are  
x

x
impossible. 
x

x
  
x

x
Personally  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
tired  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
affair. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
West  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
home,  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
folk  
x

x
are  
x

x
more  
x

x
reasonable. 
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
an  
x

x
interest  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
matter  
x

x
—  
x

x
one  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share,  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
precise,  
x

x
according  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
letter,  
x

x
which  
x

x
fortunately  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
believe  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
kept.”  
x

x
He  
x

x
drew  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
pocket  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
old  
x

x
jacket  
x

x
(which  
x

x
he  
x

x
still  
x

x
wore  
x

x
over  
x

x
his  
x

x
mail),  
x

x
  
x

x
crumpled  
x

x
and  
x

x
much  
x

x
folded,  
x

x
Thorin’s  
x

letter

x
that  
x

had

been  
x

x
put  
x

under  
x

x
the

x
clock  
x

on  
x

x
his

mantelpiece

in  
x

x
May!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A

the

you,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
on. 
x

x
“I

am

aware

of

that. 
x

x
Personally

I

am

only

too

x
  
x

x
assure  
x

x
you,  
x

x
he  
x

x
is  
x

x
quite  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
heap  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
starve,  
x

x
as  
x

x
long  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
sit  
x

x
here.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
let  
x

x
him!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
“Such  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool  
x

x
  
x

x
deserves  
x

x
to  
x

x
starve.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Quite  
x

x
so,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
see  
x

x
your  
x

x
point  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
view. 
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
time  
x

x
winter  
x

x
is  
x

x
coming

on  
x

fast. 
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
you

will

be

having

snow

x

x
what  
x

x
  
x

x
not,  
x

x
and  
x

x
supplies  
x

x
will

x
be

difficult  
x

—  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
elves  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

imagine. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
there  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
other

x
difficulties. 
x

x
  
x

x
You  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
heard  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

dwarves

of  
x

x
  
x

x
the

Iron  
x

x
Hills?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We

have,

a

long

time

ago;

what

has

he

got

to

us?”  
x

asked

the

king. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I

thought

as

much. 
x

x
I

see  
x

x
I

have

some  
x

x
information  
x

x
you

have

not

got. 
x

x
Dain,  
x

x
I  
x

may  
x

x
tell  
x

x
  
x

x
you,  
x

x
is  
x

x
now  
x

x
less  
x

x
than  
x

x
two  
x

x
days’  
x

x
march  
x

x
off,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
has  
x

x
at  
x

x
least  
x

x
five  
x

x
hundred  
x

x
grim  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
with  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
a  
x

x
good  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
have  
x

x
had  
x

x
experience  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
and  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
wars,  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
When  
x

x
they  
x

x
arrive  
x

x
there  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
serious  
x

x
trouble.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Why  
x

x
do  
x

x
you  
x

x
tell  
x

x
us  
x

x
this?  
x

x
Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
betraying  
x

x
  
x

x
your

friends,  
x

x
or  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
threatening  
x

x
us?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
grimly. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My  
x

x
dear  
x

x
Bard!”  
x

x
squeaked  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“Don’t  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
so  
x

x
hasty!  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
met  
x

x
such  
x

x
suspicious  
x

x
folk!  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
merely  
x

x
trying  
x

x
to  
x

x
avoid  
x

x
trouble  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
concerned. 
x

x
  
x

x
Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
make  
x

x
you  
x

x
an  
x

x
offer!  
x

x
!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
hear  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
they  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
may  
x

x
see  
x

x
it!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
this!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
drew  
x

x
forth  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
threw  
x

x
away  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wrapping. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
whose  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
used  
x

x
to  
x

x
things  
x

x
of  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
and  
x

x
beauty,  
x

x
stood  
x

x
up  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
amazement. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
marvelling  
x

x
at  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
silence. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
a  
x

x
globe  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
filled  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
moonlight  
x

x
and  
x

x
hung  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
net  
x

x
  
x

x
woven  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
glint  
x

x
of  
x

x
frosty  
x

x
stars. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“the  
x

x
Heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain;  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
also  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
He  
x

x
values  
x

x
it  
x

x
above  
x

x
a  
x

x
river  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
I  
x

x
give  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
you. 
x

x
It  
x

x
will  
x

x
aid  
x

x
you  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
bargaining.”  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
not  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
shudder,  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
glance  
x

x
of  
x

x
longing,  
x

x
handed  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
marvellous  
x

x
stone  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
held  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
as  
x

x
though  
x

x
dazed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
how  
x

x
is  
x

x
it  
x

x
yours  
x

x
to  
x

x
give?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
with  
x

x
an  
x

x
effort. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“O  
x

x
well!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
uncomfortably. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
  
x

x
isn’t  
x

x
exactly;  
x

x
but,  
x

x
well,  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
let  
x

x
it  
x

x
stand  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
all  
x

x
my  
x

x
claim,  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
know. 
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
—  
x

x
or  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
say:  
x

x
personally  
x

x
I  
x

x
never  
x

x
really  
x

x
  
x

x
felt  
x

x
like  
x

x
one  
x

x
—  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
an  
x

x
honest  
x

x
one,  
x

x
I  
x

x
hope,  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
or  
x

x
less. 
x

x
Anyway  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
going  
x

x
back  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
can  
x

x
do  
x

x
what  
x

x
they  
x

x
like  
x

x
to  
x

x
me. 
x

x
I  
x

x
hope  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
find  
x

x
it  
x

x
useful.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
  
x

x
wonder. 
x

x
“Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
worthy  
x

x
to  
x

x
wear  
x

x
the  
x

x
armour  
x

x
of  
x

x
elf-princes  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
many  
x

x
that  
x

x
have  
x

x
looked  
x

x
more  
x

x
comely  
x

x
in  
x

x
it. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
I  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
if  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield  
x

x
will  
x

x
see  
x

x
it  
x

x
so. 
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
more  
x

x
knowledge  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
general  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
perhaps. 
x

x
I  
x

x
advise  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
remain  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
us,  
x

x
and  
x

x
here  
x

x
you  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
honoured  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
thrice  
x

x
welcome.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Thank  
x

x
you  
x

x
very  
x

x
much  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
bow. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
think  
x

x
I  
x

x
ought  
x

x
to  
x

x
leave  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
friends  
x

x
like  
x

x
this,  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
we  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
through  
x

x
  
x

x
together. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
promised  
x

x
to  
x

x
wake  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bombur  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
midnight,  
x

x
too!  
x

x
Really  
x

x
I  
x

x
must  
x

x
be  
x

x
going,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
quickly.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Nothing  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
say  
x

x
would  
x

x
stop  
x

x
him;  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
an  
x

x
escort  
x

x
was  
x

x
provided  
x

x
for  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
  
x

x
both  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
saluted  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
honour. 
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
they  
x

x
passed  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
man,  
x

x
  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
dark  
x

x
cloak,  
x

x
rose  
x

x
from  
x

x
a  
x

x
tent  
x

x
door  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
towards  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well  
x

x
done!  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
clapping  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
back. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
always  
x

x
more  
x

x
about  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
than  
x

x
anyone  
x

x
expects!”  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
For  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
day  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
delighted. 
x

x
But  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
time  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
questions  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
immediately  
x

x
wished  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“All  
x

x
in  
x

x
good  
x

x
time!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“Things  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
now,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
mistaken. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
an  
x

x
unpleasant  
x

x
time  
x

x
just  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
front  
x

x
of  
x

x
you;  
x

x
but  
x

x
keep  
x

x
your  
x

x
heart  
x

x
up!  
x

x
You  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
through  
x

x
all  
x

x
right. 
x

x
There  
x

x
is  
x

x
news  
x

x
brewing  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
ravens  
x

x
have  
x

x
not  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
Good  
x

x
  
x

x
night!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Puzzled  
x

x
but  
x

x
cheered,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
on. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
guided  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
safe  
x

x
ford  
x

x
and  
x

x
set  
x

x
across  
x

x
dry,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
farewell  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
carefully  
x

x
back  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
weariness  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
come  
x

x
over  
x

x
him;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
well  
x

x
before  
x

x
midnight  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
clambered  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
rope  
x

x
again  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
where  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
left  
x

x
it. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
untied  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
hid  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
he  
x

x
sat  
x

x
down  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wall  
x

x
and  
x

x
wondered  
x

x
anxiously  
x

x
what  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
happen  
x

x
next. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
midnight  
x

x
he  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
Bombur;  
x

x
and  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
turn  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
himself  
x

x
up  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
corner,  
x

x
without  
x

x
  
x

x
listening  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
dwarfs  
x

x
thanks  
x

x
(which  
x

x
he  
x

x
felt  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
earned). 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
soon  
x

x
fast  
x

x
asleep  
x

x
  
x

x
forgetting  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
worries  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
As  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
matter  
x

x
of  
x

x
fact  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
dreaming  
x

x
of  
x

x
eggs  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
bacon.

x

x
THE  
x

x
CLOUDS  
x

x
BURST  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Next  
x

x
day  
x

x
the  
x

x
trumpets  
x

x
rang  
x

x
early  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp. 
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
a  
x

x
single  
x

x
runner  
x

x
was  
x

x
seen  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
path. 
x

x
At  
x

x
a  
x

x
distance  
x

x
he  
x

x
stood  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hailed  
x

x
them,  
x

x
asking  
x

x
whether  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
would  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
listen  
x

x
to  
x

x
another  
x

x
embassy,  
x

x
since  
x

x
new  
x

x
tidings  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
and  
x

x
matters  
x

x
were  
x

x
changed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
Dain!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
when  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
heard. 
x

x
“They  
x

x
will  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
wind  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
coming. 
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
that  
x

x
would  
x

x
alter  
x

x
their  
x

x
mood!  
x

x
Bid  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
few  
x

x
in  
x

x
number  
x

x
and  
x

x
weaponless,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
  
x

x
hear,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
called  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
messenger. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
About  
x

x
midday  
x

x
the  
x

x
banners  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
were  
x

x
seen  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
borne  
x

x
forth  
x

x
  
x

x
again. 
x

x
A  
x

x
company  
x

x
of  
x

x
twenty  
x

x
was  
x

x
approaching. 
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
the  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
way  
x

x
they  
x

x
laid  
x

x
  
x

x
aside  
x

x
sword  
x

x
and  
x

x
spear,  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
towards  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate. 
x

x
Wondering,  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
saw  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
them  
x

x
were  
x

x
both  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking,  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
whom  
x

x
an  
x

x
old  
x

x
man  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
bore  
x

x
a  
x

x
strong  
x

x
casket  
x

x
of  
x

x
iron-bound  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hail  
x

x
Thorin!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
“Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
still  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
mind?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“My  
x

x
mind  
x

x
does  
x

x
not  
x

x
change  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
rising  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
setting  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
few  
x

x
suns,”  
x

x
answered  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Did  
x

x
you  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
me  
x

x
idle  
x

x
questions?  
x

x
Still  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-host  
x

x
has  
x

x
not  
x

x
departed  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
bade!  
x

x
Till  
x

x
then  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
come  
x

x
in  
x

x
vain  
x

x
to  
x

x
bargain  
x

x
with  
x

x
me.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Is  
x

x
there  
x

x
then  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
for  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
yield  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
gold?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Nothing  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
or  
x

x
your  
x

x
friends  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
offer.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thrain?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
he,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
moment  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

x
man  
x

x
  
x

x
opened  
x

x
the  
x

x
casket  
x

x
and  
x

x
held  
x

x
aloft  
x

x
the  
x

x
jewel. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
bright  
x

x
and  
x

x
white  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
was  
x

x
stricken  
x

x
dumb  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
amazement  
x

x
and  
x

x
confusion. 
x

x
No  
x

x
one  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
while. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
at  
x

x
length  
x

x
broke  
x

x
the  
x

x
silence,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
voice  
x

x
was  
x

x
thick  
x

x
with  
x

x
wrath. 
x

x
“That  
x

x
stone  
x

x
was  
x

x
my  
x

x
  
x

x
father’s,  
x

x
and  
x

x
is  
x

x
mine,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Why  
x

x
should  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
purchase  
x

x
my  
x

x
own?”  
x

x
But  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
overcame  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
added:  
x

x
“But  
x

x
how  
x

x
came  
x

x
you  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
heirloom  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
house  
x

x
—  
x

x
if  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
need  
x

x
to  
x

x
ask  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
question  
x

x
of  
x

x
thieves?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
thieves,”  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
answered. 
x

x
“Your  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
return  
x

x
for  
x

x
our  
x

x
own.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“How  
x

x
came  
x

x
you  
x

x
by  
x

x
it?”  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
gathering  
x

x
rage. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
gave  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
them!”  
x

x
squeaked  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
peering  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
by  
x

x
now  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
  
x

x
fright. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You!  
x

x
You!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
turning  
x

x
upon  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
grasping  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
both

x
hands. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
hobbit!  
x

x
You  
x

x
undersized  
x

x
—  
x

x
burglar!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
shouted  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
loss  
x

x
for  
x

x
words,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
shook  
x

x
poor  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
rabbit. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“By  
x

x
the  
x

x
beard  
x

x
of  
x

x
Durin!  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
here!  
x

x
Curse  
x

x
him  
x

x
for  
x

x
his  
x

x
choice  
x

x
of  
x

x
you!  
x

x
May  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
beard  
x

x
wither!  
x

x
As  
x

x
for  
x

x
you  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
throw  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
rocks!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried  
x

x
and  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Stay!  
x

x
Your  
x

x
wish  
x

x
is  
x

x
granted!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
old  
x

x
man  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
casket  
x

x
threw  
x

x
aside  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hood  
x

x
and  
x

x
cloak. 
x

x
“Here  
x

x
is  
x

x
Gandalf!  
x

x
And  
x

x
none  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
soon  
x

x
it  
x

x
seems. 
x

x
If  
x

x
you  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
like  
x

x
my  
x

x
Burglar,  
x

x
  
x

x
please  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
damage  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Put  
x

x
him  
x

x
down,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
listen  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
what  
x

x
he  
x

x
has  
x

x
to  
x

x
say!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
all  
x

x
seem  
x

x
in  
x

x
league!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
dropping  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
top  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
“Never  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
will  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
dealings  
x

x
with  
x

x
any  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
or  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
What  
x

x
have  
x

x
you  
x

x
to  
x

x
say,  
x

x
you  
x

x
descendant  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
rats?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Dear  
x

x
me!  
x

x
Dear  
x

x
me!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
all  
x

x
very  
x

x
uncomfortable. 
x

x
You  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
remember  
x

x
saying  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
might  
x

x
choose  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share?  
x

x
Perhaps  
x

x
I  
x

x
took  
x

x
it  
x

x
too  
x

x
literally  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
—  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
told  
x

x
that  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
are  
x

x
sometimes  
x

x
  
x

x
politer  
x

x
in  
x

x
word  
x

x
than  
x

x
in  
x

x
deed. 
x

x
The  
x

x
time  
x

x
was,  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
same,  
x

x
when  
x

x
you  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
think  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
of  
x

x
some  
x

x
service. 
x

x
Descendant  
x

x
of  
x

x
rats,  
x

x
  
x

x
indeed!  
x

x
Is  
x

x
this  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
service  
x

x
of  
x

x
you  
x

x
and  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
family  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
was  
x

x
promised,  
x

x
Thorin?  
x

x
Take  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
disposed  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
share  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
wished,  
x

x
and  
x

x
let  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
go  
x

x
at  
x

x
that!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
grimly. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
let  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
go  
x

x
at  
x

x
that  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
may  
x

x
we  
x

x
never  
x

x
meet  
x

x
again!”  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
and  
x

x
spoke  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
betrayed,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
was  
x

x
rightly  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
forbear  
x

x
to  
x

x
redeem  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone,  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
of  
x

x
my  
x

x
house. 
x

x
For  
x

x
it  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
hoard  
x

x
in  
x

x
silver  
x

x
and  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
  
x

x
setting  
x

x
aside  
x

x
the  
x

x
gems;  
x

x
but  
x

x
that  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
accounted  
x

x
the  
x

x
promised  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
this  
x

x
traitor,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
reward  
x

x
he  
x

x
shall  
x

x
depart,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
can  
x

x
divide  
x

x
it  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
will. 
x

x
He  
x

x
will  
x

x
get  
x

x
little  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
doubt  
x

x
not. 
x

x
Take  
x

x
him,  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
wish  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
live;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
of  
x

x
mine  
x

x
goes  
x

x
with  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Get  
x

x
down  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
your  
x

x
friends!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“or  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
throw  
x

x
you  
x

x
down.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver?”  
x

x
asked  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“That  
x

x
shall  
x

x
follow  
x

x
after,  
x

x
as  
x

x
can  
x

x
be  
x

x
arranged,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“Get  
x

x
down!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Until  
x

x
then  
x

x
we  
x

x
keep  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone,”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
not  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
splendid  
x

x
figure  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
  
x

x
things  
x

x
may  
x

x
change  
x

x
yet.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“They  
x

x
may  
x

x
indeed,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
And  
x

x
  
x

x
already,  
x

x
so  
x

x
strong  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
bewilderment  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
upon  
x

x
him,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
pondering  
x

x
whether  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
help  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
he  
x

x
might  
x

x
not  
x

x
recapture  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
and  
x

x
withhold  
x

x
the  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
reward. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
swung  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
and  
x

x
departed  
x

x
with  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
for  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
trouble,  
x

x
except  
x

x
the  
x

x
armour  
x

x
which  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
given  
x

x
him  
x

x
already. 
x

x
More  
x

x
than  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
felt  
x

x
shame  
x

x
and  
x

x
pity  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
going. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried  
x

x
to  
x

x
them. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
may  
x

x
meet  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
as  
x

x
friends.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Be  
x

x
off!”  
x

x
called  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
have  
x

x
mail  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
you,  
x

x
which  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
by  
x

x
my  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
and  
x

x
is  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
for  
x

x
you. 
x

x
It  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
pierced  
x

x
by  
x

x
arrows;  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
if  
x

x
you  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
hasten,  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
sting  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
miserable  
x

x
feet. 
x

x
So  
x

x
be  
x

x
swift!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Not  
x

x
so  
x

x
hasty!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
will  
x

x
give  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
tomorrow. 
x

x
At  
x

x
noon  
x

x
we  
x

x
will  
x

x
return,  
x

x
and  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
brought  
x

x
from  
x

x
the

hoard  
x

x
the

portion  
x

x
that

is

to  
x

be  
x

x
set  
x

x
against  
x

the

stone. 
x

x
If

that

is  
x

x
done  
x

x
  
x

x
without  
x

x
deceit,  
x

x
then  
x

we

will

depart,

and  
x

x
the

elf-

go

back

to

the

x
Forest. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
meanwhile  
x

x
  
x

x
farewell!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
With  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
sent  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
by  
x

x
Roac  
x

x
telling  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bidding  
x

x
him  
x

x
come  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
wary  
x

x
speed. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
day  
x

x
passed  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
night. 
x

x
The  
x

x
next  
x

x
day  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wind  
x

x
shifted  
x

x
west,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
was  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
gloomy. 
x

x
The  
x

x
morning  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
early  
x

x
when  
x

x
a  
x

x
cry  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
heard  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp. 
x

x
Runners  
x

x
came  
x

x
in  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
report  
x

x
that  
x

x
a  
x

x
host  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
spur  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
and  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
now  
x

x
hastening  
x

x
to  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
Dain  
x

x
had  
x

x
come. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
on  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
night,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them  
x

x
sooner  
x

x
than  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
expected. 
x

x
  
x

x
Each  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
folk  
x

x
was  
x

x
clad  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
hauberk  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
steel  
x

x
mail  
x

x
that  
x

x
hung  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
knees,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
legs  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
covered  
x

x
with  
x

x
hose  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
fine  
x

x
and  
x

x
flexible  
x

x
  
x

x
metal  
x

x
mesh,  
x

x
the  
x

x
secret  
x

x
of  
x

x
whose  
x

x
making  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
possessed  
x

x
by  
x

x
Dain’s  
x

x
people. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
exceedingly  
x

x
strong  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
height,  
x

x
but  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
these  
x

x
were  
x

x
strong  
x

x
even  
x

x
for  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
In  
x

x
battle  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
wielded  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
two-handed  
x

x
mattocks;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
each  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
had  
x

x
also  
x

x
a  
x

x
short  
x

x
broad  
x

x
sword  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
side  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
roundshield  
x

x
slung  
x

x
at  
x

x
his  
x

x
back. 
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
beards  
x

x
were  
x

x
forked  
x

x
and  
x

x
plaited  
x

x
and  
x

x
thrust  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
their  
x

x
belts. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
caps  
x

x
were  
x

x
of  
x

x
iron  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
shod  
x

x
with  
x

x
iron,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
faces  
x

x
were  
x

x
grim. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Trumpets  
x

x
called  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
elves  
x

x
to  
x

x
arms. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Before  
x

x
long  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
coming  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
at  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
pace. 
x

x
They  
x

x
halted  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
spur;  
x

x
but  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
few  
x

x
held  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
crossing  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
  
x

x
drew  
x

x
near  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
they  
x

x
laid  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
weapons  
x

x
and  
x

x
held  
x

x
up  
x

x
their  
x

x
hands  
x

x
in  
x

x
sign  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
peace. 
x

x
Bard  
x

x
went  
x

x
out  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
went  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
sent  
x

x
from  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Nain,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
when  
x

x
questioned. 
x

x
“We  
x

x
are  
x

x
hastening  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
our  
x

x
kinsmen  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
since  
x

x
we  
x

x
learn  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
kingdom  
x

x
of  
x

x
old  
x

x
is  
x

x
renewed. 
x

x
But  
x

x
who  
x

x
are  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
sit  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
plain  
x

x
as  
x

x
foes  
x

x
before  
x

x
defended  
x

x
  
x

x
walls?”  
x

x
This,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
polite  
x

x
and  
x

x
rather  
x

x
  
x

x
old-fashioned  
x

x
language  
x

x
of  
x

x
such  
x

x
occasions,  
x

x
  
x

x
meant  
x

x
simply:  
x

x
“You  
x

x
have  
x

x
no  
x

x
business  
x

x
here. 
x

x
We  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
going  
x

x
on,  
x

x
so  
x

x
make  
x

x
way  
x

x
or  
x

x
we  
x

x
shall  
x

x
fight  
x

x
  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
They  
x

x
meant  
x

x
to  
x

x
push  
x

x
on  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
loop  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
river;  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
narrow  
x

x
land  
x

x
there  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
seem  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
strongly  
x

x
  
x

x
guarded. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
refused  
x

x
to  
x

x
allow  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
straight  
x

x
on  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
determined  
x

x
to  
x

x
wait  
x

x
until  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
brought  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
exchange  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Arkenstone;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
believe  
x

x
that  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
done,  
x

x
if  
x

x
once  
x

x
the  
x

x
fortress  
x

x
was  
x

x
manned  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
so  
x

x
large  
x

x
and  
x

x
warlike  
x

x
a  
x

x
company. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
store  
x

x
of  
x

x
supplies;  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
can  
x

x
carry  
x

x
very  
x

x
heavy  
x

x
burdens,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
all  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain’s  
x

x
folk,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
rapid  
x

x
  
x

x
march,  
x

x
bore  
x

x
huge  
x

x
packs  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
backs  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
addition  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
weapons. 
x

x
They  
x

x
would  
x

x
stand  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
siege  
x

x
for  
x

x
weeks,  
x

x
and  
x

x
by  
x

x
that  
x

x
time  
x

x
yet  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
might  
x

x
come,  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
more,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
many  
x

x
relatives. 
x

x
Also  
x

x
they  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
able  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
reopen  
x

x
and  
x

x
guard  
x

x
some  
x

x
other  
x

x
gate,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
besiegers  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
to  
x

x
encircle  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain;  
x

x
and  
x

x
for  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
sufficient  
x

x
  
x

x
numbers. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
These  
x

x
were,  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact,  
x

x
precisely  
x

x
their  
x

x
plans  
x

x
  
x

x
(for  
x

x
the  
x

x
raven-messengers  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
busy  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dain);  
x

x
but  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
moment  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
was  
x

x
barred,  
x

x
so  
x

x
after  
x

x
angry  
x

x
words  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarf-messengers  
x

x
retired  
x

x
muttering  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
beards. 
x

x
Bard  
x

x
then  
x

x
sent  
x

x
messengers  
x

x
at  
x

x
once  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
no  
x

x
gold  
x

x
or  
x

x
payment. 
x

x
  
x

x
Arrows  
x

x
came  
x

x
forth  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
within  
x

x
  
x

x
shot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
hastened  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
dismay. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
camp  
x

x
all  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
astir,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
for  
x

x
battle;  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
were  
x

x
advancing  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
eastern  
x

x
bank. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Fools!”  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
Bard,  
x

x
“to  
x

x
come  
x

x
thus  
x

x
  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain’s  
x

x
arm!  
x

x
They  
x

x
do  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
understand  
x

x
war  
x

x
above  
x

x
ground,  
x

x
whatever  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
know  
x

x
of  
x

x
battle  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mines. 
x

x
There  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
our  
x

x
archers  
x

x
and  
x

x
spearmen  
x

x
now  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
upon  
x

x
their  
x

x
right  
x

x
flank. 
x

x
Dwarf-mail  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
good,  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
will  
x

x
soon  
x

x
be  
x

x
hard  
x

x
put  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
set  
x

x
on  
x

x
them  
x

x
now  
x

x
from  
x

x
both  
x

x
sides,  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
are  
x

x
fully  
x

x
rested!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“Long  
x

x
will  
x

x
I  
x

x
tarry,  
x

x
ere  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
begin  
x

x
this  
x

x
war  
x

x
for  
x

x
gold. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
  
x

x
pass  
x

x
us,  
x

x
unless  
x

x
we  
x

x
will,  
x

x
or  
x

x
do  
x

x
anything  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
mark. 
x

x
Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
hope  
x

x
still  
x

x
for  
x

x
something  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
bring  
x

x
reconciliation. 
x

x
Our  
x

x
advantage  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
numbers  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
enough,  
x

x
if  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
it  
x

x
must  
x

x
  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
unhappy  
x

x
blows.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
reckoned  
x

x
without  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
knowledge  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hands  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
besiegers  
x

x
burned  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
thoughts;  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
they  
x

x
guessed  
x

x
the  
x

x
hesitation  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends,  
x

x
and  
x

x
resolved  
x

x
to  
x

x
strike  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
debated. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
signal  
x

x
they  
x

x
sprang  
x

x
  
x

x
silently  
x

x
forward  
x

x
to  
x

x
attack. 
x

x
Bows  
x

x
twanged  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
whistled;  
x

x
battle  
x

x
was  
x

x
about  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
joined. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Still  
x

x
more  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
a  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
swiftness!  
x

x
A  
x

x
black  
x

x
cloud  
x

x
hurried  
x

x
  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky. 
x

x
Winter  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
wild  
x

x
wind  
x

x
  
x

x
rolled  
x

x
roaring  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
rumbled  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
lightning  
x

x
lit  
x

x
its  
x

x
peak. 
x

x
And  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
another  
x

x
blackness  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
whirling  
x

x
forward;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
it  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North,  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
vast  
x

x
cloud  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
birds,  
x

x
so  
x

x
dense  
x

x
that  
x

x
no  
x

x
light  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
their  
x

x
wings. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Halt!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
who  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly,  
x

x
and  
x

x
stood  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
with  
x

x
arms  
x

x
uplifted,  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
advancing  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
ranks  
x

x
  
x

x
awaiting  
x

x
them. 
x

x
“Halt!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
called  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
voice  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
thunder,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
staff  
x

x
blazed  
x

x
forth  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
flash  
x

x
  
x

x
like  
x

x
the  
x

x
lightning. 
x

x
“Dread  
x

x
has  
x

x
come  
x

x
upon  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
all!  
x

x
Alas!  
x

x
it  
x

x
has  
x

x
come  
x

x
more  
x

x
swiftly  
x

x
than  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
guessed. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
are  
x

x
upon  
x

x
you!  
x

x
Bolg-  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
is  
x

x
coming,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Dain!  
x

x
whose  
x

x
father  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
slew  
x

x
in  
x

x
Moria. 
x

x
Behold!  
x

x
the  
x

x
bats  
x

x
are  
x

x
above  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
army  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
sea  
x

x
of  
x

x
locusts. 
x

x
They  
x

x
ride  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
are  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
train!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Amazement  
x

x
and  
x

x
confusion  
x

x
fell  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
as  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
speaking  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
grew. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
halted  
x

x
and  
x

x
gazed  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky. 
x

x
The  
x

x
elves  
x

x
cried  
x

x
out  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
voices. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come!”  
x

x
called  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
yet  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
council. 
x

x
Let  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Nain  
x

x
come  
x

x
swiftly  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
us!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
began  
x

x
a  
x

x
battle  
x

x
that  
x

x
none  
x

x
had  
x

x
expected;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
called  
x

x
the  
x

x
Battle  
x

x
of  
x

x
Five  
x

x
Armies,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
very  
x

x
terrible. 
x

x
Upon  
x

x
one  
x

x
side  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild  
x

x
Wolves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
were  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Men  
x

x
and  
x

x
Dwarves. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
how  
x

x
it  
x

x
fell  
x

x
out. 
x

x
Ever  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
fall  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Great  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblin  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
the  
x

x
hatred  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
race  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
rekindled  
x

x
to  
x

x
fury. 
x

x
  
x

x
Messengers  
x

x
had  
x

x
passed  
x

x
to  
x

x
and  
x

x
fro  
x

x
between  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
cities,  
x

x
colonies  
x

x
and  
x

x
strongholds;  
x

x
for  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
resolved  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
win  
x

x
the  
x

x
dominion  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
  
x

x
Tidings  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
in  
x

x
secret  
x

x
ways;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
forging  
x

x
and  
x

x
an  
x

x
  
x

x
arming. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
marched  
x

x
and  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
by  
x

x
hill  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
going  
x

x
ever  
x

x
by  
x

x
tunnel  
x

x
or  
x

x
under  
x

x
dark,  
x

x
  
x

x
until  
x

x
around  
x

x
and  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
Gundabad  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North,  
x

x
where  
x

x
was  
x

x
their  
x

x
capital,  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
vast  
x

x
host  
x

x
was  
x

x
assembled  
x

x
ready  
x

x
to  
x

x
sweep  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
of  
x

x
storm  
x

x
unawares  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
South. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
learned  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
death  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Smaug,  
x

x
and  
x

x
joy  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
hearts;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
hastened  
x

x
night  
x

x
after  
x

x
night  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountains,  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
thus  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
on  
x

x
a  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
hard  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
heels  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain. 
x

x
Not  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
the  
x

x
ravens  
x

x
knew  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
coming  
x

x
until  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
broken  
x

x
lands  
x

x
which  
x

x
divided  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
hills  
x

x
behind. 
x

x
How  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
knew  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
be  
x

x
said,  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
plain  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
expected  
x

x
this  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
  
x

x
assault. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
plan  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
made  
x

x
in  
x

x
council  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elven-king  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
Bard;  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
Dain,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf-lord  
x

x
now  
x

x
joined  
x

x
them:  
x

x
the  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
foes  
x

x
of  
x

x
all,  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
coming  
x

x
all  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
quarrels  
x

x
were  
x

x
forgotten. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
only  
x

x
hope  
x

x
was  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
lure  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
between  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain;  
x

x
and  
x

x
themselves  
x

x
to  
x

x
man  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
spurs  
x

x
that  
x

x
struck  
x

x
south  
x

x
and  
x

x
east. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
perilous,  
x

x
if  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
sufficient  
x

x
numbers  
x

x
to  
x

x
overrun  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
itself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
so  
x

x
attack  
x

x
them  
x

x
also  
x

x
from  
x

x
behind  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
above;  
x

x
but  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
time  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
any  
x

x
other  
x

x
  
x

x
plan,  
x

x
or  
x

x
to  
x

x
summon  
x

x
any  
x

x
help. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
passed,  
x

x
rolling  
x

x
away  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
South-East;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
bat-cloud  
x

x
came,  
x

x
flying  
x

x
  
x

x
lower,  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
shoulder  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
whirled  
x

x
above  
x

x
them  
x

x
shutting  
x

x
out  
x

x
the  
x

x
light  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
filling  
x

x
them  
x

x
with  
x

x
dread. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“To  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
called  
x

x
Bard. 
x

x
“To  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountain!  
x

x
Let  
x

x
us  
x

x
take  
x

x
our  
x

x
places  
x

x
while  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
  
x

x
yet  
x

x
time!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
On  
x

x
the  
x

x
Southern  
x

x
spur,  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
lower  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
at  
x

x
its  
x

x
feet,  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
set;  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eastern  
x

x
spur  
x

x
were  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
dwarves. 
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
nimblest  
x

x
of  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
climbed  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
height  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eastern  
x

x
  
x

x
shoulder  
x

x
to  
x

x
gain  
x

x
a  
x

x
view  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain’s  
x

x
feet  
x

x
  
x

x
black  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
hurrying  
x

x
multitude. 
x

x
Ere  
x

x
long  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
vanguard  
x

x
swirled  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
spur’s  
x

x
end  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
rushing  
x

x
into  
x

x
Dale. 
x

x
These  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
swiftest  
x

x
wolf-riders,  
x

x
and  
x

x
already  
x

x
their  
x

x
cries  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
howls  
x

x
rent  
x

x
the  
x

x
air  
x

x
afar. 
x

x
A  
x

x
few  
x

x
brave  
x

x
men  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
strung  
x

x
before  
x

x
them  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
feint  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
resistance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
there  
x

x
fell  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
drew  
x

x
back  
x

x
and  
x

x
fled  
x

x
to  
x

x
either  
x

x
side. 
x

x
As  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
hoped,  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
army  
x

x
had  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
resisted  
x

x
vanguard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
poured  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
rage  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
driving  
x

x
wildly  
x

x
up  
x

x
between  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
arms  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
seeking  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
foe. 
x

x
  
x

x
Their  
x

x
banners  
x

x
were  
x

x
countless,  
x

x
black  
x

x
and  
x

x
red,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
on  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
tide  
x

x
in  
x

x
fury  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
disorder. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
battle. 
x

x
The  
x

x
most  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
experiences,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
which  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
he  
x

x
hated  
x

x
most  
x

x
—  
x

x
which  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
most  
x

x
proud  
x

x
of,  
x

x
and  
x

x
most  
x

x
fond  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
recalling  
x

x
long  
x

x
afterwards,  
x

x
although  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
  
x

x
unimportant  
x

x
in  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Actually  
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
say  
x

x
he  
x

x
put  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring  
x

x
early  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
business,  
x

x
and  
x

x
vanished  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
sight,  
x

x
if  
x

x
not  
x

x
from  
x

x
all  
x

x
danger. 
x

x
A  
x

x
magic  
x

x
ring  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
sort  
x

x
is  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
complete  
x

x
protection  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
charge,  
x

x
nor  
x

x
does  
x

x
it  
x

x
stop  
x

x
flying  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
wild  
x

x
spears;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
does  
x

x
help  
x

x
in  
x

x
getting  
x

x
out  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
way,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
prevents  
x

x
your  
x

x
head  
x

x
from  
x

x
being  
x

x
  
x

x
specially  
x

x
chosen  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
sweeping  
x

x
stroke  
x

x
by  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
swordsman. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
to  
x

x
charge. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
  
x

x
hatred  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
is  
x

x
cold  
x

x
and  
x

x
bitter. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
  
x

x
spears  
x

x
and  
x

x
swords  
x

x
shone  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
of  
x

x
chill  
x

x
flame,  
x

x
so  
x

x
deadly  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hands  
x

x
that  
x

x
held  
x

x
them. 
x

x
As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
host  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
enemies  
x

x
was  
x

x
dense  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley,  
x

x
they  
x

x
sent  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
it  
x

x
a  
x

x
shower  
x

x
of  
x

x
arrows,  
x

x
and  
x

x
each  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
flickered  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
fled  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
with  
x

x
stinging  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
Behind  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
arrows  
x

x
a  
x

x
thousand  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
spearmen  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
  
x

x
down  
x

x
and  
x

x
charged. 
x

x
The  
x

x
yells  
x

x
were  
x

x
deafening. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
were  
x

x
stained  
x

x
black  
x

x
with  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
blood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Just  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
recovering  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
onslaught  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-charge  
x

x
was  
x

x
halted,  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
rose  
x

x
from  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
a  
x

x
deep-  
x

x
  
x

x
throated  
x

x
roar. 
x

x
With  
x

x
cries  
x

x
of  
x

x
“Moria!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
“Dain,  
x

x
  
x

x
Dain!”  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Iron  
x

x
Hills  
x

x
plunged  
x

x
in,  
x

x
  
x

x
wielding  
x

x
their  
x

x
mattocks,  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
beside  
x

x
them  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
long  
x

x
swords. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Panic  
x

x
came  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
Goblins;  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
turned  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
this  
x

x
new  
x

x
attack,  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
  
x

x
charged  
x

x
again  
x

x
with  
x

x
renewed  
x

x
numbers. 
x

x
Already  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
flying  
x

x
back  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
river  
x

x
to  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
trap;  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
own  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
were  
x

x
turning  
x

x
upon  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
rending  
x

x
the  
x

x
dead  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wounded. 
x

x
Victory  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
at  
x

x
hand,  
x

x
when  
x

x
a  
x

x
cry  
x

x
rang  
x

x
out  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
heights  
x

x
above. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
had  
x

x
scaled  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
and  
x

x
already  
x

x
many  
x

x
were  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
slopes  
x

x
above  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
others  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
streaming  
x

x
down  
x

x
recklessly,  
x

x
heedless  
x

x
of  
x

x
those  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
fell  
x

x
screaming  
x

x
from  
x

x
cliff  
x

x
and  
x

x
precipice,  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
attack  
x

x
the  
x

x
spurs  
x

x
from  
x

x
above. 
x

x
Each  
x

x
of  
x

x
these  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
reached  
x

x
by  
x

x
paths  
x

x
that  
x

x
ran  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
main  
x

x
mass  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
centre;  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
defenders  
x

x
had  
x

x
too  
x

x
few  
x

x
to  
x

x
bar  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
long. 
x

x
Victory  
x

x
now  
x

x
vanished  
x

x
from  
x

x
hope. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
only  
x

x
stemmed  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
onslaught  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
black  
x

x
tide. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Day  
x

x
drew  
x

x
on. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
again  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
There  
x

x
a  
x

x
host  
x

x
of  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
ravening  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
came  
x

x
the  
x

x
bodyguard  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Bolg,  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
of  
x

x
huge  
x

x
size  
x

x
with  
x

x
scimitars  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
steel. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
actual  
x

x
darkness  
x

x
was  
x

x
coming  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stormy  
x

x
sky;  
x

x
while  
x

x
still  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
bats  
x

x
swirled  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
heads  
x

x
and  
x

x
ears  
x

x
of  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
men,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
fastened  
x

x
vampire-like  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
stricken. 
x

x
Now  
x

x
  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
was  
x

x
fighting  
x

x
to  
x

x
defend  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eastern  
x

x
spur,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

x
giving  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
back;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
elf-lords  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
at  
x

x
bay  
x

x
about  
x

x
their  
x

x
king  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
southern  
x

x
  
x

x
arm,  
x

x
near  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
watch-post  
x

x
on  
x

x
Ravenhill. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
shout,  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate  
x

x
came  
x

x
a  
x

x
trumpet  
x

x
call. 
x

x
They  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
forgotten  
x

x
Thorin!  
x

x
Part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall,  
x

x
moved  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
levers,  
x

x
fell  
x

x
outward  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
crash  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
pool. 
x

x
  
x

x
Out  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
the  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
companions  
x

x
followed  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Hood  
x

x
and  
x

x
cloak  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
gone;  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
shining  
x

x
armour,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
red  
x

x
light  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
gleamed  
x

x
like  
x

x
gold  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
dying  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Rocks  
x

x
were  
x

x
hurled  
x

x
down  
x

x
from  
x

x
on  
x

x
high  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
above;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
held  
x

x
on,  
x

x
leapt  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
falls’  
x

x
foot,  
x

x
and  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
forward  
x

x
to  
x

x
battle. 
x

x
  
x

x
Wolf  
x

x
and  
x

x
rider  
x

x
fell  
x

x
or  
x

x
fled  
x

x
before  
x

x
them. 
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
wielded  
x

x
his  
x

x
axe  
x

x
with  
x

x
mighty  
x

x
strokes,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
harm  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“To  
x

x
me!  
x

x
To  
x

x
me!  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
Men!  
x

x
To  
x

x
me!  
x

x
O  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
kinsfolk!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice  
x

x
shook  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
horn  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Down,  
x

x
heedless  
x

x
of  
x

x
order,  
x

x
rushed  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
of  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
help. 
x

x
Down  
x

x
too  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-men,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
restrain  
x

x
them;  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
side  
x

x
came  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
spearmen  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves. 
x

x
Once  
x

x
again  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
stricken  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
piled  
x

x
in  
x

x
heaps  
x

x
till  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
was  
x

x
dark  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hideous  
x

x
with  
x

x
their  
x

x
corpses. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
and  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
drove  
x

x
right  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
bodyguard  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bolg. 
x

x
But  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
pierce  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
ranks. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Already  
x

x
behind  
x

x
him  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
dead  
x

x
  
x

x
lay  
x

x
many  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fair  
x

x
elf  
x

x
that  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
lived  
x

x
yet  
x

x
long  
x

x
ages  
x

x
  
x

x
merrily  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood. 
x

x
And  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
widened  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
onset  
x

x
grew  
x

x
ever  
x

x
slower. 
x

x
His  
x

x
numbers  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
too  
x

x
few. 
x

x
His  
x

x
flanks  
x

x
were  
x

x
unguarded. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
attackers  
x

x
were  
x

x
attacked,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
forced  
x

x
  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
ring,  
x

x
facing  
x

x
every  
x

x
way,  
x

x
hemmed  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
with  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
returning  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
assault. 
x

x
The  
x

x
bodyguard  
x

x
of  
x

x
Bolg  
x

x
came  
x

x
howling  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
drove  
x

x
in  
x

x
upon  
x

x
their  
x

x
ranks  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
waves  
x

x
upon  
x

x
cliffs  
x

x
of  
x

x
sand. 
x

x
Their  
x

x
friends  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
help  
x

x
them,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
assault  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
renewed  
x

x
with  
x

x
redoubled  
x

x
force,  
x

x
and  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
either  
x

x
side  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
elves  
x

x
were  
x

x
being  
x

x
slowly  
x

x
  
x

x
beaten  
x

x
down. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
On  
x

x
all  
x

x
this  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
looked  
x

x
with  
x

x
misery. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
taken  
x

x
his  
x

x
stand  
x

x
on  
x

x
Ravenhill  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elves  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
partly  
x

x
because  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
chance  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
escape  
x

x
from  
x

x
that  
x

x
point,  
x

x
and  
x

x
partly  
x

x
(with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
more  
x

x
Tookish  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
mind)  
x

x
because  
x

x
if  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
going  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
last  
x

x
desperate  
x

x
stand,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
preferred  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
whole  
x

x
to  
x

x
defend  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking. 
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
too,  
x

x
I  
x

x
may  
x

x
say,  
x

x
was  
x

x
there,  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ground  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
in  
x

x
deep  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
preparing,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
suppose,  
x

x
some  
x

x
last  
x

x
blast  
x

x
of  
x

x
magic  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
That  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
seem  
x

x
far  
x

x
off. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
now,”  
x

x
thought  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“before  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
win  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
all  
x

x
slaughtered  
x

x
or  
x

x
driven  
x

x
down  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
captured. 
x

x
Really  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
one  
x

x
  
x

x
weep,  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
one  
x

x
has  
x

x
gone  
x

x
through. 
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
rather  
x

x
old  
x

x
Smaug  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
left  
x

x
with  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wretched  
x

x
treasure,  
x

x
than  
x

x
that  
x

x
these  
x

x
vile  
x

x
creatures  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
get  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
poor  
x

x
old  
x

x
Bombur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
rest  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
  
x

x
end;  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
too,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-men  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
merry  
x

x
elves. 
x

x
Misery  
x

x
me!  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
heard  
x

x
songs  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
many  
x

x
battles,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
always  
x

x
understood  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
defeat  
x

x
may  
x

x
be  
x

x
glorious. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seems  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
uncomfortable,  
x

x
not  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
distressing. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
well  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
clouds  
x

x
were  
x

x
torn  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
  
x

x
sunset  
x

x
slashed  
x

x
the  
x

x
West. 
x

x
Seeing  
x

x
the  
x

x
sudden  
x

x
  
x

x
gleam  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
gloom  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
looked  
x

x
round. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
gave  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
cry:  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
seen  
x

x
a  
x

x
sight  
x

x
that  
x

x
made  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
heart  
x

x
leap,  
x

x
dark  
x

x
shapes  
x

x
small  
x

x
yet  
x

x
majestic  
x

x
  
x

x
against  
x

x
the  
x

x
distant  
x

x
glow. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
Eagles!  
x

x
The  
x

x
Eagles!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
shouted. 
x

x
“The  
x

x
  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
are  
x

x
coming!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
were  
x

x
seldom  
x

x
wrong. 
x

x
The  
x

x
  
x

x
eagles  
x

x
were  
x

x
coming  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
wind,  
x

x
line  
x

x
after  
x

x
  
x

x
line,  
x

x
in  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
host  
x

x
as  
x

x
must  
x

x
have  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
eyries  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
Eagles!  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles!”  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
  
x

x
dancing  
x

x
and  
x

x
waving  
x

x
his  
x

x
arms. 
x

x
If  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
see  
x

x
him  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
hear  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Soon  
x

x
they  
x

x
too  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
cry,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
echoed  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
  
x

x
Many  
x

x
wondering  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
looked  
x

x
up,  
x

x
though  
x

x
as  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
could  
x

x
be  
x

x
seen  
x

x
except  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
southern  
x

x
  
x

x
shoulders  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
Eagles!”  
x

x
cried  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
once  
x

x
more,  
x

x
but  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
moment  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone  
x

x
hurtling  
x

x
from  
x

x
above  
x

x
smote  
x

x
  
x

x
heavily  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
helm,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
crash  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
knew  
x

x
no  
x

x
more.

x
THE  
x

x
RETURN  
x

x
JOURNEY  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
literally  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
lying  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
flat  
x

x
stones  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Ravenhill,  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
was  
x

x
near. 
x

x
A  
x

x
cloudless  
x

x
  
x

x
day,  
x

x
but  
x

x
cold,  
x

x
was  
x

x
broad  
x

x
above  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
shaking,  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
chilled  
x

x
as  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
but  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
  
x

x
burned  
x

x
with  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
"Now  
x

x
I  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
what  
x

x
has  
x

x
happened?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself. 
x

x
“At  
x

x
any  
x

x
rate  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
heroes;  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
there  
x

x
is  
x

x
still  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
enough  
x

x
for  
x

x
that!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
sat  
x

x
up  
x

x
painfully. 
x

x
Looking  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
no  
x

x
living  
x

x
goblins. 
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
head  
x

x
cleared  
x

x
a  
x

x
little,  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
elves  
x

x
moving  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
rocks  
x

x
below. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
rubbed  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes. 
x

x
Surely  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
camp  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
plain  
x

x
some  
x

x
distance  
x

x
off;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
coming  
x

x
and  
x

x
going  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate?  
x

x
Dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
busy  
x

x
removing  
x

x
the  
x

x
wall. 
x

x
But  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
deadly  
x

x
still. 
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
no  
x

x
call  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
echo  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
song. 
x

x
Sorrow  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
air. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Victory  
x

x
after  
x

x
all,  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said,  
x

x
feeling  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
aching  
x

x
head. 
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
it  
x

x
seems  
x

x
a  
x

x
very  
x

x
gloomy  
x

x
  
x

x
business.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Suddenly  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
aware  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
man  
x

x
climbing  
x

x
  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
coming  
x

x
towards  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hullo  
x

x
there!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
called  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
shaky  
x

x
voice. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Hullo  
x

x
there!  
x

x
What  
x

x
news?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“What  
x

x
voice  
x

x
is  
x

x
it  
x

x
that  
x

x
speaks  
x

x
among  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
stones?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
man  
x

x
halting  
x

x
and  
x

x
peering  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
him  
x

x
not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
where  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sat. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
remembered  
x

x
his  
x

x
ring!  
x

x
“Well  
x

x
I’m  
x

x
  
x

x
blessed!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he. 
x

x
“This  
x

x
invisibility  
x

x
has  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
drawbacks  
x

x
after  
x

x
all. 
x

x
Otherwise  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
I  
x

x
might  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
spent  
x

x
a  
x

x
warm  
x

x
and  
x

x
comfortable  
x

x
night  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
bed!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It’s  
x

x
me,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
companion  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried,  
x

x
hurriedly  
x

x
taking  
x

x
off  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
well  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
found  
x

x
you!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
man  
x

x
striding  
x

x
forward. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
needed  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
looked  
x

x
for  
x

x
you  
x

x
long. 
x

x
You  
x

x
would  
x

x
have  
x

x
been  
x

x
  
x

x
numbered  
x

x
among  
x

x
the

dead,  
x

x
who  
x

are

many,

if  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
the

wizard  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
your  
x

x
voice  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
last  
x

x
heard  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

place. 
x

x
I  
x

have

been

sent

to  
x

x
  
x

x
look

here  
x

for  
x

x
the  
x

last

time. 
x

x
Are  
x

x
you  
x

x
much  
x

x
hurt?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
knock  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
head,  
x

x
I  
x

x
think,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“But

I

have

a

skull. 
x

x
All  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
same  
x

x
I  
x

x
feel  
x

x
sick  
x

x
and  
x

x
my  
x

x
legs  
x

x
are  
x

x
like  
x

x
straws.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
carry  
x

x
you  
x

x
down  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
valley,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
man,  
x

x
and  
x

x
picked  
x

x
him  
x

x
lightly  
x

x
up. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
man  
x

x
was  
x

x
swift  
x

x
and  
x

x
sure-footed. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
set  
x

x
down  
x

x
before  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
tent  
x

x
in  
x

x
Dale;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
stood  
x

x
Gandalf,  
x

x
with  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
arm  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
sling. 
x

x
Even  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
escaped  
x

x
without  
x

x
a  
x

x
wound;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
few  
x

x
  
x

x
unharmed  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
host. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
saw  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
delighted. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Baggins!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
exclaimed. 
x

x
“Well  
x

x
I  
x

x
never!  
x

x
Alive  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
all  
x

x
—  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
glad!  
x

x
I  
x

x
began  
x

x
to  
x

x
wonder  
x

x
if  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
luck  
x

x
would  
x

x
see  
x

x
you  
x

x
through!  
x

x
A  
x

x
terrible  
x

x
  
x

x
business,  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
nearly  
x

x
was  
x

x
disastrous. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
other  
x

x
news  
x

x
can  
x

x
wait. 
x

x
Come!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
gravely. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
are  
x

x
called  
x

x
for;”  
x

x
and  
x

x
leading  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
he  
x

x
took  
x

x
him  
x

x
within  
x

x
the  
x

x
tent. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Hail!  
x

x
Thorin,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
entered. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
  
x

x
brought  
x

x
him.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
lay  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield,  
x

x
  
x

x
wounded  
x

x
with  
x

x
many  
x

x
wounds,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
rent  
x

x
  
x

x
armour  
x

x
and  
x

x
notched  
x

x
axe  
x

x
were  
x

x
cast  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
floor. 
x

x
He  
x

x
looked  
x

x
up  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
came  
x

x
beside  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell,  
x

x
good  
x

x
thief,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
go  
x

x
now  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
halls  
x

x
of  
x

x
waiting  
x

x
to  
x

x
sit  
x

x
beside  
x

x
my  
x

x
fathers,  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
is  
x

x
renewed. 
x

x
Since  
x

x
I  
x

x
leave  
x

x
now  
x

x
all  
x

x
gold  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver,  
x

x
and  
x

x
go  
x

x
where  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
of  
x

x
little  
x

x
worth,  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
wish  
x

x
to  
x

x
part  
x

x
in  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
from  
x

x
you,  
x

x
and  
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
  
x

x
take  
x

x
back  
x

x
my  
x

x
words  
x

x
and  
x

x
deeds  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Gate.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
knelt  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
knee  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
sorrow. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell,  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“This  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
bitter  
x

x
adventure,  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
must  
x

x
end  
x

x
so;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
mountain  
x

x
of  
x

x
gold  
x

x
can  
x

x
amend  
x

x
it. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
  
x

x
glad  
x

x
that  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
shared  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
perils  
x

x
—  
x

x
that  
x

x
has  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
any  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
deserves.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“No!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Thorin. 
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
more  
x

x
in  
x

x
you  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
good  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
know,  
x

x
child  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kindly  
x

x
West. 
x

x
  
x

x
Some  
x

x
courage  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
wisdom,  
x

x
blended  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
measure. 
x

x
If  
x

x
more  
x

x
of  
x

x
us  
x

x
valued  
x

x
food  
x

x
and  
x

x
cheer  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
song  
x

x
above  
x

x
hoarded  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
it  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
merrier  
x

x
world. 
x

x
But  
x

x
sad  
x

x
or  
x

x
merry,  
x

x
I  
x

x
must  
x

x
leave  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
now. 
x

x
Farewell!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
turned  
x

x
away,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
by  
x

x
  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sat  
x

x
alone  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
blanket,  
x

x
  
x

x
and,  
x

x
whether  
x

x
you  
x

x
believe  
x

x
it  
x

x
or  
x

x
not,  
x

x
he  
x

x
wept  
x

x
until  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
eyes  
x

x
were  
x

x
red  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice  
x

x
was  
x

x
hoarse. 
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
kindly  
x

x
little  
x

x
soul. 
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
before  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
heart  
x

x
to  
x

x
make  
x

x
a  
x

x
joke  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
mercy  
x

x
it  
x

x
is,”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
himself,  
x

x
“that  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
woke  
x

x
up  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
did. 
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
were  
x

x
living,  
x

x
  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
glad  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
parted  
x

x
in  
x

x
kindness. 
x

x
You  
x

x
  
x

x
are  
x

x
a  
x

x
fool,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
made  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
great  
x

x
mess  
x

x
of  
x

x
that  
x

x
business  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
stone;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
battle,  
x

x
in  
x

x
spite  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
your  
x

x
efforts  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
buy  
x

x
peace  
x

x
and  
x

x
quiet,  
x

x
but  
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
be  
x

x
blamed  
x

x
for  
x

x
that.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
All  
x

x
that  
x

x
had  
x

x
happened  
x

x
after  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
stunned,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
learned  
x

x
later;  
x

x
but  
x

x
it  
x

x
gave  
x

x
him  
x

x
more  
x

x
sorrow  
x

x
  
x

x
than  
x

x
joy,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
weary  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
adventure. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
aching  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
bones  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
homeward  
x

x
journey  
x

x
That,  
x

x
however,  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
little  
x

x
  
x

x
delayed,  
x

x
so  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
meantime  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
tell  
x

x
something  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
events. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
had  
x

x
long  
x

x
had  
x

x
suspicion  
x

x
  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins’  
x

x
mustering;  
x

x
from  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
watchfulness  
x

x
the  
x

x
movements  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
altogether  
x

x
hid. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
too  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
in  
x

x
great  
x

x
numbers,  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
Eagle  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
Mountains;  
x

x
and  
x

x
at  
x

x
length  
x

x
  
x

x
smelling  
x

x
battle  
x

x
from  
x

x
afar  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
  
x

x
speeding  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
gale  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
nick  
x

x
of  
x

x
time. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
who  
x

x
dislodged  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mountain-slopes,  
x

x
casting  
x

x
them  
x

x
over  
x

x
precipices,  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
driving  
x

x
them  
x

x
down  
x

x
shrieking  
x

x
and  
x

x
bewildered  
x

x
  
x

x
among  
x

x
their  
x

x
foes. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
not  
x

x
long  
x

x
before  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
freed  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
men  
x

x
on  
x

x
either  
x

x
side  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
could  
x

x
come  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
help  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
battle  
x

x
below. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
But  
x

x
even  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
still  
x

x
  
x

x
outnumbered. 
x

x
In  
x

x
that  
x

x
last  
x

x
hour  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
himself  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
—  
x

x
no  
x

x
one  
x

x
knew  
x

x
how  
x

x
or  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
where. 
x

x
He  
x

x
came  
x

x
alone,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
bear’s  
x

x
shape;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
have  
x

x
grown  
x

x
almost  
x

x
to  
x

x
giant-  
x

x
  
x

x
size  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
wrath. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
roar  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
voice  
x

x
was  
x

x
like  
x

x
drums  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
guns;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
tossed  
x

x
wolves  
x

x
and  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
from  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
path  
x

x
like  
x

x
straws  
x

x
and  
x

x
feathers. 
x

x
He  
x

x
fell  
x

x
upon  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
rear,  
x

x
and  
x

x
broke  
x

x
like  
x

x
a  
x

x
clap  
x

x
of  
x

x
thunder  
x

x
  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
ring. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
were  
x

x
making  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
stand  
x

x
still  
x

x
about  
x

x
their  
x

x
lords  
x

x
upon  
x

x
a  
x

x
low  
x

x
rounded  
x

x
  
x

x
hill. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
stooped  
x

x
and  
x

x
lifted  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
who  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
pierced  
x

x
with  
x

x
spears,  
x

x
and  
x

x
bore  
x

x
him  
x

x
  
x

x
out  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
fray. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Swiftly  
x

x
he  
x

x
returned  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
wrath  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
redoubled,  
x

x
so  
x

x
that  
x

x
nothing  
x

x
could  
x

x
withstand  
x

x
him,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
no  
x

x
weapon  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
bite  
x

x
upon  
x

x
him. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
scattered  
x

x
the  
x

x
bodyguard,  
x

x
and  
x

x
pulled  
x

x
down  
x

x
Bolg  
x

x
  
x

x
himself  
x

x
and  
x

x
crushed  
x

x
him. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
dismay  
x

x
fell  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Goblins  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
fled  
x

x
in  
x

x
all  
x

x
directions. 
x

x
But  
x

x
  
x

x
weariness  
x

x
left  
x

x
their  
x

x
enemies  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
coming  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
new  
x

x
hope,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
pursued  
x

x
them  
x

x
closely,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
prevented  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
from  
x

x
escaping  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
could. 
x

x
They  
x

x
drove  
x

x
many  
x

x
of  
x

x
them  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River,  
x

x
and  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
fled  
x

x
south  
x

x
or  
x

x
west  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
marshes  
x

x
about  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
  
x

x
River;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
the  
x

x
greater  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
  
x

x
fugitives  
x

x
perished,  
x

x
while  
x

x
those  
x

x
that  
x

x
came  
x

x
hardly  
x

x
  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wood-elves’  
x

x
realm  
x

x
were  
x

x
there  
x

x
slain,  
x

x
or  
x

x
  
x

x
drawn  
x

x
in  
x

x
to  
x

x
die  
x

x
deep  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trackless  
x

x
dark  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
Songs  
x

x
have  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
three  
x

x
parts  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblin  
x

x
warriors  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
North  
x

x
perished  
x

x
on  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
day,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
had  
x

x
peace  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
year. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Victory  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
assured  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
fall  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
night;  
x

x
but  
x

x
the  
x

x
pursuit  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
on  
x

x
foot,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
returned  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
camp;  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
many  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
save  
x

x
the  
x

x
more  
x

x
grievously  
x

x
wounded. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Where  
x

x
are  
x

x
the  
x

x
Eagles?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
asked  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
evening,  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
lay  
x

x
wrapped  
x

x
in  
x

x
many  
x

x
warm  
x

x
  
x

x
blankets. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Some  
x

x
are  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hunt,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard,  
x

x
“but  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
have  
x

x
gone  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
their  
x

x
eyries. 
x

x
They  
x

x
  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
stay  
x

x
here,  
x

x
and  
x

x
departed  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
first  
x

x
  
x

x
light  
x

x
of  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
Dain  
x

x
has  
x

x
crowned  
x

x
their  
x

x
chief  
x

x
  
x

x
with  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
and  
x

x
sworn  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
with  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
forever.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sorry. 
x

x
I  
x

x
mean,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
liked  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
see  
x

x
them  
x

x
again,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
sleepily;  
x

x
“perhaps  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
see  
x

x
them  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
home. 
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
going  
x

x
home  
x

x
soon?”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“As  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
you  
x

x
like,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Actually  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
some  
x

x
days  
x

x
before  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
really  
x

x
set  
x

x
out. 
x

x
They  
x

x
buried  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
deep  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
laid  
x

x
the  
x

x
Arkenstone  
x

x
  
x

x
upon  
x

x
his  
x

x
breast. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
let  
x

x
it  
x

x
lie  
x

x
till  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
falls!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“May  
x

x
it  
x

x
bring  
x

x
good  
x

x
fortune  
x

x
to  
x

x
all  
x

x
his  
x

x
folk  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
dwell  
x

x
here  
x

x
after!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Upon  
x

x
his  
x

x
tomb  
x

x
the  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
then  
x

x
laid  
x

x
  
x

x
Orcrist,  
x

x
the  
x

x
elvish  
x

x
sword  
x

x
that  
x

had  
x

x
been  
x

x
taken  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
in  
x

x
captivity. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
said  
x

x
in  
x

x
songs  
x

x
that  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
gleamed  
x

x
ever  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
dark  
x

x
if  
x

x
foes  
x

x
approached,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
fortress  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
taken  
x

x
by  
x

x
surprise. 
x

x
There  
x

x
now  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
son  
x

x
of  
x

x
Nain  
x

x
  
x

x
took  
x

x
up  
x

x
his  
x

x
abode,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
became  
x

x
King  
x

x
under  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

Mountain,  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
time  
x

x
many  
x

x
other  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
throne  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
ancient  
x

x
halls. 
x

x
Of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
twelve  
x

x
companions  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
ten  
x

x
remained. 
x

x
  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
defending  
x

x
him  
x

x
with  
x

x
shield  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

body,  
x

x
for  
x

he

was

their

mother’s

elder

brother. 
x

x
The  
x

x
others  
x

x
remained  
x

x
with  
x

x
Dain;  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
dealt  
x

x
his  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
well. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
no

x
longer  
x

x
any

question

of

dividing

the

in  
x

such

shares

as  
x

x

had

been

planned,

to  
x

Balin

Dwalin,

Bifur

Bofur

x
and

Bombur  
x

x
—  
x

or  
x

to  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
the

silver  
x

and  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
  
x

wrought  
x

x
and  
x

x
unwrought,  
x

x
was  
x

x
given  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
Bard;  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“We

will

honour

the

agreement  
x

x
of

the

he

now

the

x
Even  
x

x
a  
x

x
fourteenth  
x

x
share  
x

x
was  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
  
x

x
exceedingly  
x

x
great,  
x

x
greater  
x

x
than  
x

x
that  
x

x
of  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
mortal  
x

x
kings. 
x

x
From  
x

x
that  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
sent  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
gold  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
Master  
x

x
of  
x

x
Lake-town;  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
rewarded  
x

x
his  
x

x
followers  
x

x
and  
x

x
friends  
x

x
freely. 
x

x
To  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Elvenking  
x

x
he  
x

x
gave  
x

x
the  
x

x
emeralds  
x

x
of  
x

x
Girion,  
x

x
such  
x

x
  
x

x
jewels  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
most  
x

x
loved,  
x

x
which  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
restored  
x

x
to  
x

x
him. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
To  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
he  
x

x
said:  
x

x
“This  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
is  
x

x
as  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
yours  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
mine;  
x

x
though  
x

x
old  
x

x
agreements  
x

x
  
x

x
cannot  
x

x
stand,  
x

x
since  
x

x
so  
x

x
many  
x

x
have  
x

x
a  
x

x
claim  
x

x
in  
x

x
its  
x

x
  
x

x
winning  
x

x
and  
x

x
defence. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
even  
x

x
though  
x

x
you  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
willing  
x

x
to  
x

x
lay  
x

x
aside  
x

x
all  
x

x
your  
x

x
claim,  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
wish  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
words  
x

x
of  
x

x
Thorin,  
x

x
of  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
repented,  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
not  
x

x
prove  
x

x
true:  
x

x
that  
x

x
we  
x

x
should  
x

x
give  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
little. 
x

x
I  
x

x
would  
x

x
reward  
x

x
you  
x

x
most  
x

x
richly  
x

x
of  
x

x
all.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Very  
x

x
kind  
x

x
of  
x

x
you,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
really  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
relief  
x

x
to  
x

x
me. 
x

x
How  
x

x
on  
x

x
earth  
x

x
should  
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
got  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
that  
x

x
treasure  
x

x
home  
x

x
without  
x

x
war  
x

x
and  
x

x
murder  
x

x
  
x

x
all  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
way,  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know. 
x

x
And  
x

x
I  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
what  
x

x
I  
x

x
should  
x

x
have  
x

x
done  
x

x
with  
x

x
it  
x

x
when  
x

x
I  
x

x
got  
x

x
home. 
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sure  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
better  
x

x
in  
x

x
your  
x

x
hands.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
In  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
only  
x

x
take  
x

x
two  
x

x
small  
x

x
  
x

x
chests,  
x

x
one  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
silver,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
other  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
gold,  
x

x
such  
x

x
as  
x

x
one  
x

x
strong  
x

x
pony  
x

x
could  
x

x
carry. 
x

x
“That  
x

x
  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
quite  
x

x
as  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
manage,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
he. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
came  
x

x
for  
x

x
him  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
good-  
x

x
  
x

x
bye  
x

x
to  
x

x
his  
x

x
friends. 
x

x
“Farewell,  
x

x
Balin!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said;  
x

x
  
x

x
“and  
x

x
farewell,  
x

x
Dwalin;  
x

x
and  
x

x
farewell  
x

x
Dori,  
x

x
Nori,  
x

x
  
x

x
Ori,  
x

x
Oin,  
x

x
Gloin,  
x

x
Bifur,  
x

x
Bofur,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bombur!  
x

x
May  
x

x
  
x

x
your  
x

x
beards  
x

x
never  
x

x
grow  
x

x
thin!”  
x

x
And  
x

x
turning  
x

x
  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
he  
x

x
added:  
x

x
“Farewell  
x

x
  
x

x
Thorin  
x

x
Oakenshield!  
x

x
And  
x

x
Fili  
x

x
and  
x

x
Kili!  
x

x
May  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
memory  
x

x
never  
x

x
fade!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
bowed  
x

x
low  
x

x
before  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
Gate,  
x

x
but  
x

x
words  
x

x
stuck  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
throats. 
x

x
“Good-  
x

x
  
x

x
bye  
x

x
and  
x

x
good  
x

x
luck,  
x

x
wherever  
x

x
you  
x

x
fare!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
at  
x

x
last. 
x

x
“If  
x

x
ever  
x

x
you  
x

x
visit  
x

x
us  
x

x
again,  
x

x
when  
x

x
our  
x

x
  
x

x
halls  
x

x
are  
x

x
made  
x

x
fair  
x

x
once  
x

x
more,  
x

x
then  
x

x
the  
x

x
feast  
x

x
  
x

x
shall  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
be  
x

x
splendid!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“If  
x

x
ever  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
passing  
x

x
my  
x

x
way,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
“don’t  
x

x
wait  
x

x
to  
x

x
knock!  
x

x
Tea  
x

x
is  
x

x
at  
x

x
four;  
x

x
but  
x

x
  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
welcome  
x

x
at  
x

x
anytime!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
he  
x

x
turned  
x

x
away. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
elf-host  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
march;  
x

x
and  
x

x
if  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
sadly  
x

x
lessened,  
x

x
yet  
x

x
many  
x

x
were  
x

x
glad,  
x

x
for  
x

x
now  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
northern  
x

x
world  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
merrier  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
  
x

x
day. 
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
was  
x

x
dead,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
  
x

x
overthrown,  
x

x
and  
x

x
their  
x

x
hearts  
x

x
looked  
x

x
forward  
x

x
  
x

x
after  
x

x
winter  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
spring  
x

x
of  
x

x
joy. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
rode  
x

x
behind  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Elvenking,  
x

x
and  
x

x
beside  
x

x
them  
x

x
strode  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
once  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
in  
x

x
man’s  
x

x
shape,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
laughed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
sang  
x

x
in  
x

x
a  
x

x
loud  
x

x
voice  
x

x
upon  
x

x
the  
x

x
road. 
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
went  
x

x
on  
x

x
until  
x

x
they  
x

x
drew  
x

x
near  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
borders  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
north  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
River  
x

x
ran  
x

x
out. 
x

x
Then  
x

x
they  
x

x
halted,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
would  
x

x
not  
x

x
enter  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood,  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
though  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
bade  
x

x
them  
x

x
stay  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
halls. 
x

x
They  
x

x
intended  
x

x
to  
x

x
go  
x

x
along  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
forest,  
x

x
and  
x

x
round  
x

x
its  
x

x
northern  
x

x
end  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
waste  
x

x
that  
x

x
lay  
x

x
between  
x

x
it  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
beginning  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Grey  
x

x
Mountains. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
and  
x

x
cheerless  
x

x
  
x

x
road,  
x

x
but  
x

x
now  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
crushed,  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
safer  
x

x
to  
x

x
them  
x

x
than  
x

x
the  
x

x
dreadful  
x

x
  
x

x
pathways  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees. 
x

x
Moreover  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
going  
x

x
that  
x

x
way  
x

x
too. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell!  
x

x
O  
x

x
Elvenking!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
“Merry  
x

x
be  
x

x
the  
x

x
greenwood,  
x

x
while  
x

x
the  
x

x
world  
x

x
is  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
young!  
x

x
And  
x

x
merry  
x

x
be  
x

x
all  
x

x
your  
x

x
folk!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Farewell!  
x

x
O  
x

x
Gandalf!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
king. 
x

x
“May  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
ever  
x

x
appear  
x

x
where  
x

x
you  
x

x
are  
x

x
most  
x

x
needed  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
least  
x

x
expected!  
x

x
The  
x

x
oftener  
x

x
you  
x

x
appear  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
my  
x

x
halls  
x

x
the  
x

x
better  
x

x
shall  
x

x
I  
x

x
be  
x

x
pleased!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
beg  
x

x
of  
x

x
you,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
stammering  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
standing  
x

x
on  
x

x
one  
x

x
foot,  
x

x
“to  
x

x
accept  
x

x
this  
x

x
gift!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
brought  
x

x
out  
x

x
a  
x

x
necklace  
x

x
of  
x

x
silver  
x

x
and  
x

x
pearls  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
Dain  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
him  
x

x
at  
x

x
their  
x

x
parting. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“In  
x

x
what  
x

x
way  
x

x
have  
x

x
I  
x

x
earned  
x

x
such  
x

x
a  
x

x
gift,  
x

x
O  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit?”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
king. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Well,  
x

x
er,  
x

x
I  
x

x
thought,  
x

x
don’t  
x

x
you  
x

x
know,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
rather  
x

x
confused,  
x

x
“that,  
x

x
er,  
x

x
some  
x

x
little  
x

x
return  
x

x
  
x

x
should  
x

x
be  
x

x
made  
x

x
for  
x

x
your,  
x

x
er,  
x

x
hospitality. 
x

x
I  
x

x
mean  
x

x
  
x

x
even  
x

x
a  
x

x
burglar  
x

x
has  
x

x
his  
x

x
feelings. 
x

x
I  
x

x
have  
x

x
drunk  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
wine  
x

x
and  
x

x
eaten  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
your  
x

x
  
x

x
bread.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“I  
x

x
will  
x

x
take  
x

x
your  
x

x
gift,  
x

x
O  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Magnificent!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
king  
x

x
gravely. 
x

x
“And  
x

x
I  
x

x
name  
x

x
  
x

x
you  
x

x
elf-friend  
x

x
and  
x

x
blessed. 
x

x
May  
x

x
your  
x

x
shadow  
x

x
  
x

x
never  
x

x
grow  
x

x
less  
x

x
(or  
x

x
stealing  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
too  
x

x
easy)!  
x

x
  
x

x
Farewell!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
turned  
x

x
towards  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
started  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
long  
x

x
road  
x

x
home. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
many  
x

x
hardships  
x

x
and  
x

x
adventures  
x

x
before  
x

x
  
x

x
he  
x

x
got  
x

x
back. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Wild  
x

x
was  
x

x
still  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
other  
x

x
things  
x

x
in  
x

x
it  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
days  
x

x
  
x

x
beside  
x

x
goblins;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
well  
x

x
guided  
x

x
and  
x

x
well  
x

x
  
x

x
guarded  
x

x
—  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
was  
x

x
with  
x

x
him,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
—  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
never  
x

x
in  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
danger  
x

x
again. 
x

x
Anyway  
x

x
by  
x

x
midwinter  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
way  
x

x
back,  
x

x
along  
x

x
  
x

x
both  
x

x
edges  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Forest,  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
doors  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
house;  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
for  
x

x
a  
x

x
while  
x

x
they  
x

x
both  
x

x
  
x

x
stayed. 
x

x
Yule-tide  
x

x
was  
x

x
warm  
x

x
and  
x

x
merry  
x

x
there;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
men  
x

x
came  
x

x
from  
x

x
far  
x

x
and  
x

x
wide  
x

x
to  
x

x
feast  
x

x
at  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn’s  
x

x
bidding. 
x

x
The  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
were  
x

x
now  
x

x
few  
x

x
and  
x

x
terrified,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
deepest  
x

x
holes  
x

x
they  
x

x
could  
x

x
find;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wargs  
x

x
had  
x

x
vanished  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
woods,  
x

x
so  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
men  
x

x
went  
x

x
abroad  
x

x
without  
x

x
fear. 
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
  
x

x
indeed  
x

x
became  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
chief  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
those  
x

x
regions  
x

x
and  
x

x
ruled  
x

x
a  
x

x
wide  
x

x
land  
x

x
between  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood;  
x

x
and  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
said  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
generations  
x

x
the  
x

x
men  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
line  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
power  
x

x
of  
x

x
taking  
x

x
bear’s  
x

x
shape,  
x

x
and  
x

x
some  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
grim  
x

x
men  
x

x
and  
x

x
bad,  
x

x
but  
x

x
most  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
heart  
x

x
like  
x

x
  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
if  
x

x
less  
x

x
in  
x

x
size  
x

x
and  
x

x
strength. 
x

x
In  
x

x
their  
x

x
day  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
were  
x

x
hunted  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
Misty  
x

x
  
x

x
Mountains  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
new  
x

x
peace  
x

x
came  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
spring,  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
fair  
x

x
one  
x

x
with  
x

x
mild  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
weathers  
x

x
and  
x

x
a  
x

x
bright  
x

x
sun,  
x

x
before  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
took  
x

x
their  
x

x
leave  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
though  
x

x
he  
x

x
longed  
x

x
for  
x

x
home,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
left  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
regret,  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
gardens  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
springtime  
x

x
no  
x

x
less  
x

x
marvellous  
x

x
than  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
summer. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
At  
x

x
last  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
the  
x

x
long  
x

x
road,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
reached  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
pass  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
goblins  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
captured  
x

x
them  
x

x
before. 
x

x
But  
x

x
they  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
high  
x

x
point  
x

x
at  
x

x
morning,  
x

x
and  
x

x
looking  
x

x
backward  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
saw  
x

x
a  
x

x
white  
x

x
sun  
x

x
shining  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
outstretched  
x

x
lands. 
x

x
There  
x

x
behind  
x

x
lay  
x

x
Mirkwood,  
x

x
  
x

x
blue  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
darkly  
x

x
green  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
nearer  
x

x
edge  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
spring. 
x

x
There  
x

x
far  
x

x
away  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lonely  
x

x
Mountain  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
eyesight. 
x

x
On  
x

x
its  
x

x
highest  
x

x
peak  
x

x
snow  
x

x
yet  
x

x
  
x

x
unmelted  
x

x
was  
x

x
gleaming  
x

x
pale. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“So  
x

x
comes  
x

x
snow  
x

x
after  
x

x
fire,  
x

x
and  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
dragons  
x

x
have  
x

x
their  
x

x
ending!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
turned  
x

x
his  
x

x
back  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
adventure. 
x

x
The  
x

x
Tookish  
x

x
  
x

x
part  
x

x
was  
x

x
getting  
x

x
very  
x

x
tired,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
daily  
x

x
getting  
x

x
stronger. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
now  
x

x
only  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
be  
x

x
in  
x

x
my  
x

x
own  
x

x
armchair!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
said.

Chapter

X

x
IX  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
THE  
x

x
LAST  
x

x
STAGE  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
on  
x

x
May  
x

x
the  
x

x
First  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
two  
x

x
came  
x

x
back  
x

x
  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
brink  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
of  
x

x
Rivendell,  
x

x
  
x

x
where  
x

x
stood  
x

x
the  
x

x
Last  
x

x
(or  
x

x
the  
x

x
First)  
x

x
Homely  
x

x
  
x

x
House. 
x

x
Again  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
evening,  
x

x
their  
x

x
ponies  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
tired,  
x

x
especially  
x

x
the  
x

x
one  
x

x
that  
x

x
carried  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
baggage;  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
all  
x

x
felt  
x

x
in  
x

x
need  
x

x
of  
x

x
rest. 
x

x
As  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
rode  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
steep  
x

x
path,  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
heard  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elves  
x

x
still  
x

x
singing  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees,  
x

x
as  
x

x
if  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
since  
x

x
he  
x

x
left;  
x

x
and  
x

x
as  
x

x
soon  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
riders  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
down  
x

x
into  
x

x
the  
x

x
lower  
x

x
glades  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wood  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
burst  
x

x
into  
x

x
a  
x

x
song  
x

x
of  
x

x
much  
x

x
the  
x

x
same  
x

x
kind  
x

x
as  
x

x
  
x

x
before. 
x

x
This  
x

x
is  
x

x
something  
x

x
like  
x

x
it:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
is  
x

x
withered,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
bones  
x

x
are  
x

x
nowcrumbled;  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
armour  
x

x
is  
x

x
shivered,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
splendour  
x

x
is  
x

x
humbled!  
x

x
  
x

x
Though  
x

x
svnrd  
x

x
shall  
x

x
be  
x

x
rusted,  
x

x
  
x

x
And

throne

x
With

strength

that

men

trusted

And  
x

x
wealth

that

they

Here  
x

x
grass

is  
x

still

growing,  
x

x

x
And  
x

x
leaves

are

yet

swinging,

The

white

water

flowing,

And

elves

singing

Come!

Tra-la-la-lally!  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

Come

to

x
the

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
stars  
x

x
are  
x

x
far  
x

x
brighter  
x

x
  
x

x
Than

gems  
x

x
without

measure,  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
moon

is  
x

x
far  
x

x
whiter  
x

x
  
x

x
Than

x
silver  
x

x
in

x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

On

the

gold

won

x

x

So

x

x

Come

So

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

flowing,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The

burning!  
x

x
  
x

x
O!  
x

x
Whither  
x

x
so  
x

x
laden,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
sad  
x

x
and  
x

x
so

dreary?  
x

x

Here

Nowwelcome

Come

Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
came  
x

x
out  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
greeted  
x

x
them  
x

x
and  
x

x
led  
x

x
them  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
water  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
of  
x

x
Elrond. 
x

x
There  
x

x
a  
x

x
warm  
x

x
welcome  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
made  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
many  
x

x
eager  
x

x
  
x

x
ears  
x

x
that  
x

x
evening  
x

x
to  
x

x
hear  
x

x
the  
x

x
tale  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
  
x

x
adventures. 
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
who  
x

x
spoke,  
x

x
for  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
and  
x

x
drowsy. 
x

x
Most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
tale  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
knew,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
in  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
had  
x

x
himself  
x

x
told  
x

x
  
x

x
much  
x

x
of  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
on  
x

x
their  
x

x
homeward  
x

x
way  
x

x
  
x

x
or  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
house  
x

x
of  
x

x
Beorn;  
x

x
but  
x

x
every  
x

x
now  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
again  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
open  
x

x
one  
x

x
eye,  
x

x
and  
x

x
listen,  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
part  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
story  
x

x
which  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
yet  
x

x
know  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
in. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
way  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
learned  
x

x
where  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
to;  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
overheard  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
words  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard  
x

x
to  
x

x
Elrond. 
x

x
It  
x

x
appeared  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
council  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
white  
x

x
  
x

x
wizards,  
x

x
masters  
x

x
of  
x

x
lore  
x

x
and  
x

x
good  
x

x
magic;  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
driven  
x

x
the  
x

x
Necromancer  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
his  
x

x
dark  
x

x
hold  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
south  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mirkwood. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Ere  
x

x
long  
x

x
now,”  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
was  
x

x
saying,  
x

x
“the  
x

x
  
x

x
Forest  
x

x
will  
x

x
grow  
x

x
somewhat  
x

x
more  
x

x
wholesome. 
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
North  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
freed  
x

x
from  
x

x
that  
x

x
horror  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
years,  
x

x
I  
x

x
hope. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
I  
x

x
wish  
x

x
he  
x

x
were  
x

x
banished  
x

x
  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
world!”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“It  
x

x
would  
x

x
be  
x

x
well  
x

x
indeed,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Elrond;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
I  
x

x
  
x

x
fear  
x

x
that  
x

x
will  
x

x
not  
x

x
come  
x

x
about  
x

x
in  
x

x
this  
x

x
age  
x

x
of

the

world,

or  
x

x
for  
x

x
many  
x

x
after.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
When  
x

x
the  
x

x
tale  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
journeyings  
x

x
was  
x

x
told,  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
other  
x

tales,

x
and  
x

x
yet  
x

more

tales,  
x

x
tales  
x

x

of

long

and

tales

of

of

x
no

at  
x

all,

till  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
head  
x

x
fell  
x

x
forward  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
his

chest,

snored

in

a

corner. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
woke  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
himself  
x

x
in  
x

x
a

Below

waken  
x

x
a  
x

x
stone  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon  
x

x
—  
x

x
yet  
x

x
we  
x

x
thank  
x

x
you,”  
x

x
they  
x

x
answered  
x

x
with  
x

x
  
x

x
laughter. 
x

x
“It  
x

x
is  
x

x
drawing  
x

x
towards  
x

x
dawn,  
x

x
and  
x

x
you  
x

x
  
x

x
have  
x

x
slept  
x

x
now  
x

x
since  
x

x
the  
x

x
night’s  
x

x
beginning. 
x

x
  
x

x
Tomorrow,  
x

x
perhaps,  
x

x
you  
x

x
will  
x

x
be  
x

x
cured  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
weariness.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“A  
x

x
little  
x

x
sleep  
x

x
does  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
cure  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
house  
x

x
of  
x

x
Elrond,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
he;  
x

x
“but  
x

x
I  
x

x
will  
x

x
take  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
cure  
x

x
I  
x

x
can  
x

x
get. 
x

x
A  
x

x
second  
x

x
good  
x

x
night,  
x

x
fair  
x

x
  
x

x
friends!”  
x

x
And  
x

x
with  
x

x
that  
x

x
he  
x

x
went  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
bed  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
slept  
x

x
till  
x

x
late  
x

x
morning. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Weariness  
x

x
fell  
x

x
from  
x

x
him  
x

x
soon  
x

x
in  
x

x
that  
x

x
house,  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
many  
x

x
a  
x

x
merry  
x

x
jest  
x

x
and  
x

x
dance,  
x

x
early  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
late,  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
elves  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley. 
x

x
Yet  
x

x
even  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
place  
x

x
could  
x

x
not  
x

x
long  
x

x
delay  
x

x
him  
x

x
now,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
thought  
x

x
always  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
home. 
x

x
After  
x

x
a  
x

x
week,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
therefore,  
x

x
he  
x

x
said  
x

x
farewell  
x

x
to  
x

x
Elrond,  
x

x
and  
x

x
giving  
x

x
  
x

x
him  
x

x
such  
x

x
small  
x

x
gifts  
x

x
as  
x

x
he  
x

x
would  
x

x
accept,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
rode  
x

x
away  
x

x
with  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Even  
x

x
as  
x

x
they  
x

x
left  
x

x
the  
x

x
valley  
x

x
the  
x

x
sky  
x

x
darkened  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
West  
x

x
before  
x

x
them,  
x

x
and  
x

x
wind  
x

x
and  
x

x
rain  
x

x
  
x

x
came  
x

x
up  
x

x
to  
x

x
meet  
x

x
them. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Merry  
x

x
is  
x

x
May-time!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
as  
x

x
the  
x

x
rain  
x

x
  
x

x
beat  
x

x
into  
x

x
his  
x

x
face. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
our  
x

x
back  
x

x
is  
x

x
to  
x

x
legends  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
we  
x

x
are  
x

x
coming  
x

x
home. 
x

x
I  
x

x
suppose  
x

x
this  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
first  
x

x
taste  
x

x
of  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“There  
x

x
is  
x

x
a  
x

x
long  
x

x
road  
x

x
yet,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“But  
x

x
it  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
road,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
came  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
that  
x

x
marked  
x

x
the  
x

x
very  
x

x
  
x

x
edge  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
borderland  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Wild,  
x

x
and  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
ford  
x

x
beneath  
x

x
the  
x

x
steep  
x

x
bank,  
x

x
which  
x

x
you  
x

x
may  
x

x
  
x

x
remember. 
x

x
The  
x

x
water  
x

x
was  
x

x
swollen  
x

x
both  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
melting  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
snows  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
approach  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
summer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
with  
x

x
the  
x

x
daylong  
x

x
rain;  
x

x
but  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
with  
x

x
some  
x

x
difficulty,  
x

x
and  
x

x
pressed  
x

x
  
x

x
forward,  
x

x
as  
x

x
evening  
x

x
fell,  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
last  
x

x
stage  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
their  
x

x
journey. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
This  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
as  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
before,  
x

x
  
x

x
except  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
company  
x

x
was  
x

x
smaller,  
x

x
and  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
silent;  
x

x
also  
x

x
this  
x

x
time  
x

x
there  
x

x
were  
x

x
no  
x

x
trolls. 
x

x
At  
x

x
  
x

x
each  
x

x
point  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
recalled  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
happenings  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
words  
x

x
of  
x

x
a  
x

x
year  
x

x
ago  
x

x
—  
x

x
it  
x

x
  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
more  
x

x
like  
x

x
ten  
x

x
—  
x

x
so  
x

x
that,  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course,  
x

x
he  
x

x
quickly  
x

x
noted  
x

x
the  
x

x
place  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
pony  
x

x
had  
x

x
fallen  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
river,  
x

x
and  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
turned  
x

x
  
x

x
aside  
x

x
for  
x

x
their  
x

x
nasty  
x

x
adventure  
x

x
with  
x

x
Tom  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
Bert  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bill. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Not  
x

x
far  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
road  
x

x
they  
x

x
found  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trolls,  
x

x
which  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
buried,  
x

x
still  
x

x
hidden  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
untouched. 
x

x
“I  
x

x
have  
x

x
enough  
x

x
to  
x

x
last  
x

x
me  
x

x
my  
x

x
time,”  
x

x
  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
had  
x

x
dug  
x

x
it  
x

x
up. 
x

x
“You  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
better  
x

x
take  
x

x
this,  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
I  
x

x
daresay  
x

x
you  
x

x
can  
x

x
find  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
use  
x

x
for  
x

x
it.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Indeed  
x

x
I  
x

x
can!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
the  
x

x
wizard. 
x

x
“But  
x

x
share  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
share  
x

x
alike!  
x

x
You  
x

x
may  
x

x
find  
x

x
you  
x

x
have  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
needs  
x

x
than  
x

x
you  
x

x
expect.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
So  
x

x
they  
x

x
put  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
in  
x

x
bags  
x

x
and  
x

x
slung  
x

x
them  
x

x
  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
ponies,  
x

x
who  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
at  
x

x
all  
x

x
pleased  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
about  
x

x
it. 
x

x
After  
x

x
that  
x

x
their  
x

x
going  
x

x
was  
x

x
slower,  
x

x
for  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
time  
x

x
they  
x

x
walked. 
x

x
But  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
green  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
much  
x

x
grass  
x

x
through  
x

x
which  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
strolled  
x

x
along  
x

x
contentedly. 
x

x
He  
x

x
  
x

x
mopped  
x

x
his  
x

x
face  
x

x
with  
x

x
a  
x

x
red  
x

x
silk  
x

x
handkerchief  
x

x
—  
x

x
  
x

x
no!  
x

x
not  
x

x
a  
x

x
single  
x

x
one  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
had  
x

x
survived,  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
borrowed  
x

x
this  
x

x
one  
x

x
from  
x

x
Elrond  
x

x
—  
x

x
for  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

x
June  
x

x
had  
x

x
brought  
x

x
summer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
weather  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
bright  
x

x
and  
x

x
hot  
x

x
again. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
As  
x

x
all  
x

x
things  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
an  
x

x
end,  
x

x
even  
x

x
this  
x

x
  
x

x
story,  
x

x
a  
x

x
day  
x

x
came  
x

x
at  
x

x
last  
x

x
when  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
sight  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
country  
x

x
where  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
been  
x

x
born  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
bred,  
x

x
where  
x

x
the  
x

x
shapes  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
land  
x

x
and  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
trees  
x

x
were  
x

x
as  
x

x
well  
x

x
known  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
as  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hands  
x

x
and  
x

x
toes. 
x

x
Coming  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
rise  
x

x
he  
x

x
could  
x

x
see  
x

x
  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
distance,  
x

x
and  
x

x
he  
x

x
stopped  
x

x
  
x

x
suddenly  
x

x
and  
x

x
said:  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Roads  
x

x
go  
x

x
ever  
x

x
ever  
x

x
on,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Over  
x

x
rock  
x

x
and  
x

x
under  
x

x
tree,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
By  
x

x
caves  
x

x
wh  
x

x
ere  
x

x
never  
x

x
sun  
x

x
has  
x

x
shone,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
By  
x

x
streams  
x

x
that  
x

x
never  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
sea;  
x

x
  
x

x
Over  
x

x
snow  
x

x
by  
x

x
winter  
x

x
sown,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
through  
x

x
the  
x

x
merry  
x

x
flowers  
x

x
of  
x

x
June,  
x

x
  
x

x
Overgrass  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
stone,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
under  
x

x
mountains  
x

x
in  
x

x

And

horror

in

the

x

x

x
Look

on

And

trees

x

x
hills  
x

x
they  
x

x
long  
x

x
have

x
known. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
looked  
x

x
at  
x

x
him. 
x

x
“My  
x

x
dear  
x

x
Bilbo!”  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
said. 
x

x
“Something  
x

x
is  
x

x
the  
x

x
matter  
x

x
with  
x

x
you!  
x

x
You  
x

x
are  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbit  
x

x
that  
x

x
you  
x

x
were.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
And  
x

x
so  
x

x
they  
x

x
crossed  
x

x
the  
x

x
bridge  
x

x
and  
x

x
passed  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
mill  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
river  
x

x
and  
x

x
came  
x

x
right  
x

x
back  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo’s  
x

x
own  
x

x
door. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Bless  
x

x
me!  
x

x
What’s  
x

x
going  
x

x
on?”  
x

x
he  
x

x
cried. 
x

x
  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
commotion,  
x

x
and  
x

x
people  
x

x
of  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
sorts,  
x

x
respectable  
x

x
and  
x

x
unrespectable,  
x

x
were  
x

x
  
x

x
thick  
x

x
round  
x

x
the  
x

x
door,  
x

x
and  
x

x
many  
x

x
were  
x

x
going  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
out  
x

x
—  
x

x
not  
x

x
even  
x

x
wiping  
x

x
their  
x

x
feet  
x

x
on  
x

x
the  
x

x
mat,  
x

x
  
x

x
as  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
with  
x

x
annoyance. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
If  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
surprised,  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
surprised  
x

x
still. 
x

x
He  
x

x
had  
x

x
arrived  
x

x
back  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
middle  
x

x
of  
x

x
an  
x

x
auction!  
x

x
There  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
large  
x

x
notice  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
black  
x

x
and  
x

x
red  
x

x
hung  
x

x
on  
x

x
the

x
stating

the

ten

sharp.

It

was  
x

x
now  
x

x
  
x

nearly  
x

x
lunchtime,

most

Bilbo’s  
x

x
cousins  
x

x
the  
x

x
Sackville-  
x

x
  
x

x
Bagginses  
x

x
were,  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact,  
x

x
busy  
x

x
measuring  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
rooms  
x

x
to  
x

x
see  
x

x
if  
x

x
their  
x

x
own

furniture  
x

x
would  
x

x
fit. 
x

x
In  
x

x
  
x

x
short  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
“Presumed  
x

x
Dead”,  
x

x
and  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
everybody  
x

x
that  
x

x
said  
x

x
so  
x

x
was  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
to  
x

x
find  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
presumption  
x

x
wrong. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
return  
x

x
of  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
created  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
disturbance,  
x

x
both  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
Hill  
x

x
and  
x

x
over  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Hill,  
x

x
and  
x

x
across  
x

x
the  
x

x
Water;  
x

x
it  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
deal  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
a  
x

x
nine  
x

x
days’  
x

x
wonder. 
x

x
The  
x

x
legal  
x

x
  
x

x
bother,  
x

x
indeed,  
x

x
lasted  
x

x
for  
x

x
years. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
long  
x

x
time  
x

x
before  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
  
x

x
admitted  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
alive  
x

x
again. 
x

x
The  
x

x
people  
x

x
who  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
got  
x

x
specially  
x

x
good  
x

x
bargains  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
Sale  
x

x
took  
x

x
a  
x

x
  
x

x
deal  
x

x
of  
x

x
convincing;  
x

x
and  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
to  
x

x
save  
x

x
time  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
had  
x

x
to  
x

x
buy  
x

x
back  
x

x
quite  
x

x
a  
x

x
lot  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
own  
x

x
  
x

x
furniture. 
x

x
Many  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
silver  
x

x
spoons  
x

x
mysteriously  
x

x
  
x

x
disappeared  
x

x
and  
x

x
were  
x

x
never  
x

x
accounted  
x

x
for. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Personally  
x

x
he  
x

x
suspected  
x

x
the  
x

x
Sackville-  
x

x
  
x

x
Bagginses. 
x

x
On  
x

x
their  
x

x
side  
x

x
they  
x

x
never  
x

x
admitted  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
the  
x

x
returned  
x

x
Baggins  
x

x
was  
x

x
genuine,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
on  
x

x
friendly  
x

x
terms  
x

x
with  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
ever  
x

x
  
x

x
after. 
x

x
They  
x

x
really  
x

x
had  
x

x
wanted  
x

x
to  
x

x
live  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
nice  
x

x
  
x

x
hobbit-hole  
x

x
so  
x

x
very  
x

x
much. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
Indeed  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
found  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
more  
x

x
than  
x

x
  
x

x
spoons  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
had  
x

x
lost  
x

x
his  
x

x
reputation. 
x

x
It  
x

x
is  
x

x
true  
x

x
  
x

x
that  
x

x
for  
x

x
ever  
x

x
after  
x

x
he  
x

x
remained  
x

x
an  
x

x
elf-friend,  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
had  
x

x
the  
x

x
honour  
x

x
of  
x

x
dwarves,  
x

x
wizards,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
  
x

x
such  
x

x
folk  
x

x
as  
x

x
ever  
x

x
passed  
x

x
that  
x

x
way;  
x

x
but  
x

x
he  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
no  
x

x
longer  
x

x
quite  
x

x
respectable. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
in  
x

x
fact  
x

x
held  
x

x
  
x

x
by  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
hobbits  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
neighbourhood  
x

x
to  
x

x
be  
x

x
  
x

x
‘queer’  
x

x
—  
x

x
except  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
nephews  
x

x
and  
x

x
nieces  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Took  
x

x
side,  
x

x
but  
x

x
even  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
not  
x

x
  
x

x
encouraged  
x

x
in  
x

x
their  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
by  
x

x
their  
x

x
elders. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
I  
x

x
am  
x

x
sorry  
x

x
to  
x

x
say  
x

x
he  
x

x
did  
x

x
not  
x

x
mind. 
x

x
He  
x

x
was  
x

x
  
x

x
quite  
x

x
content;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
sound  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kettle  
x

x
on  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
hearth  
x

x
was  
x

x
ever  
x

x
after  
x

x
more  
x

x
musical  
x

x
than  
x

x
it  
x

x
had  
x

x
  
x

x
been  
x

x
even  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
quiet  
x

x
days  
x

x
before  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Unexpected  
x

x
Party. 
x

x
His  
x

x
sword  
x

x
he  
x

x
hung  
x

x
over  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
mantelpiece. 
x

x
His  
x

x
coat  
x

x
of  
x

x
mail  
x

x
was  
x

x
arranged  
x

x
on  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
stand  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
hall  
x

x
(until  
x

x
he  
x

x
lent  
x

x
it  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
Museum). 
x

x
  
x

x
His  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
silver  
x

x
was  
x

x
largely  
x

x
spent  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
presents,  
x

x
both  
x

x
useful  
x

x
and  
x

x
extravagant  
x

x
—  
x

x
which  
x

x
to  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
certain  
x

x
extent  
x

x
accounts  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
affection  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
nephews  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
nieces. 
x

x
His  
x

x
magic  
x

x
ring  
x

x
he  
x

x
  
x

x
kept  
x

x
a  
x

x
great  
x

x
secret,  
x

x
for  
x

x
he  
x

x
chiefly  
x

x
used  
x

x
it  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
unpleasant  
x

x
callers  
x

x
came. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
He  
x

x
took  
x

x
to  
x

x
writing  
x

x
poetry  
x

x
and  
x

x
visiting  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
elves;  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
many  
x

x
shook  
x

x
their  
x

x
heads  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
touched  
x

x
their  
x

x
foreheads  
x

x
and  
x

x
said  
x

x
“Poor  
x

x
old  
x

x
  
x

x
Baggins!”  
x

x
and  
x

x
though  
x

x
few  
x

x
believed  
x

x
any  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
tales,  
x

x
he  
x

x
remained  
x

x
very  
x

x
happy  
x

x
to  
x

x
the  
x

x
end  
x

x
of  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
days,  
x

x
and  
x

x
those  
x

x
were  
x

x
extraordinarily  
x

x
long. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
One  
x

x
autumn  
x

x
evening  
x

x
some  
x

x
years  
x

x
afterwards  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
was  
x

x
sitting  
x

x
in  
x

x
his  
x

x
study  
x

x
writing  
x

x
his  
x

x
  
x

x
memoirs  
x

x
—  
x

x
he  
x

x
thought  
x

x
of  
x

x
calling  
x

x
them  
x

x
“There  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
Back  
x

x
Again,  
x

x
a  
x

x
Hobbit’s  
x

x
Holiday”  
x

x
—  
x

x
when  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
a  
x

x
ring  
x

x
at  
x

x
the  
x

x
door. 
x

x
It  
x

x
was  
x

x
Gandalf  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
a  
x

x
dwarf;  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
dwarf  
x

x
was  
x

x
actually  
x

x
Balin. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Come  
x

x
in!  
x

x
Come  
x

x
in!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Bilbo,  
x

x
and  
x

x
soon  
x

x
  
x

x
they  
x

x
were  
x

x
settled  
x

x
in  
x

x
chairs  
x

x
by  
x

x
the  
x

x
fire. 
x

x
If  
x

x
Balin  
x

x
  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
Mr. 
x

x
Baggins’  
x

x
waistcoat  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
  
x

x
extensive  
x

x
(and  
x

x
had  
x

x
real  
x

x
gold  
x

x
buttons),  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
  
x

x
also  
x

x
noticed  
x

x
that  
x

x
Balin’s  
x

x
beard  
x

x
was  
x

x
several  
x

x
  
x

x
inches  
x

x
longer,  
x

x
and  
x

x
his  
x

x
jewelled  
x

x
belt  
x

x
was  
x

x
of  
x

x
great  
x

x
  
x

x
magnificence. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

x
fell  
x

x
to  
x

x
talking  
x

x
of  
x

x
their  
x

x
times  
x

x
together,  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
course,  
x

x
and  
x

x
Bilbo  
x

x
asked  
x

x
how  
x

x
things  
x

x
were  
x

x
going  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
lands  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
Mountain. 
x

x
It  
x

x
seemed  
x

x
they  
x

x
  
x

x
were  
x

x
going  
x

x
very  
x

x
well. 
x

x
Bard  
x

x
had  
x

x
rebuilt  
x

x
the  
x

x
town  
x

x
  
x

x
in  
x

x
Dale  
x

x
and  
x

x
men  
x

x
had  
x

x
gathered  
x

x
to  
x

x
him  
x

x
from  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
Lake  
x

x
and  
x

x
from  
x

x
South  
x

x
and  
x

x
West,  
x

x
and  
x

x
all  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
valley  
x

x
had  
x

x
become  
x

x
tilled  
x

x
again  
x

x
and  
x

x
rich,  
x

x
and  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
desolation  
x

x
was  
x

x
now  
x

x
filled  
x

x
with  
x

x
birds  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
blossoms  
x

x
in  
x

x
spring  
x

x
and  
x

x
fruit  
x

x
and  
x

x
feasting  
x

x
in  
x

x
  
x

x
autumn. 
x

x
And  
x

x
Lake-town  
x

x
was  
x

x
refounded  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
was  
x

x
more  
x

x
prosperous  
x

x
than  
x

x
ever,  
x

x
and  
x

x
much  
x

x
  
x

x
wealth  
x

x
went  
x

x
up  
x

x
and  
x

x
down  
x

x
the  
x

x
Running  
x

x
River;  
x

x
  
x

x
and  
x

x
there  
x

x
was  
x

x
friendship  
x

x
in  
x

x
those  
x

x
parts  
x

x
  
x

x
between  
x

x
elves  
x

x
and  
x

x
dwarves  
x

x
and

x
men.

Baggins

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
The  
x

x
old  
x

x
Master  
x

x
had  
x

x
come  
x

x
to  
x

x
a  
x

x
bad  
x

x
end. 
x

x
  
x

x
Bard  
x

x
had  
x

x
given  
x

x
him  
x

x
much  
x

x
gold  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
help  
x

x
of  
x

x
  
x

x
the  
x

x
Lake-people,  
x

x
but  
x

x
being  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
kind  
x

x
that  
x

x
  
x

x
easily  
x

x
catches  
x

x
such  
x

x
disease  
x

x
he  
x

x
fell  
x

x
under  
x

x
the  
x

x
  
x

x
dragon-sickness,  
x

x
and  
x

x
took  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
gold  
x

x
and  
x

x
  
x

x
fled  
x

x
with  
x

x
it,  
x

x
and  
x

x
died  
x

x
of  
x

x
starvation  
x

x
in  
x

x
the  
x

x
Waste,  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
deserted  
x

x
by  
x

x
his  
x

x
companions. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“The  
x

x
new  
x

x
Master  
x

x
is  
x

x
of  
x

x
wiser  
x

x
kind,”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Balin,  
x

x
“and  
x

x
very  
x

x
popular,  
x

x
for,  
x

x
of  
x

x
course,  
x

x
he  
x

x
gets  
x

x
  
x

x
most  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
credit  
x

x
for  
x

x
the  
x

x
present

prosperity. 
x

x
  
x

x
They  
x

are  
x

making  
x

songs  
x

x
which  
x

say

that

in

his

x
  
x

x
day  
x

x
the

rivers  
x

x
run  
x

x
with

gold.”  
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Then  
x

x
the  
x

x
prophecies  
x

x
of  
x

x
the  
x

x
old  
x

turned

out

be

true,

after

a

fashion!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
  
x

x
Bilbo. 
x

x
  
x

x
  
x

x
“Of  
x

x
course!”  
x

x
said  
x

x
Gandalf. 
x

x
“And  
x

why  
x

should  
x

x
  
x

x
not  
x

they

prove

true?

Surely

you

don’t  
x

x
disbelieve  
x

x
  
x

the

You
